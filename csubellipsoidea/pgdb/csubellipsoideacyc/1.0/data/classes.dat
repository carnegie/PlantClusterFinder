UNIQUE-ID - Generalized-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, it contains only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been
/assigned.  To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.

COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - A group of frames, usually all of the same class, that are associated together in a single logical collection.  This is a utility class -- its only slot of its own is group-members.  Each of its subclasses will define a type of collection, and specify the class of frames that can be members.

UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cell-Types
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is used to distinguish between different types of cells within a single organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Promoter-Boxes
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Records the location of the "boxes" upstream of a transcription start site that are recognized by RNA polymerase.
//
UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.

UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - molecular_function
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).

TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/

//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathways

COMMON-NAME - a nonspecific substrate
COMMENT - This class was created for substrates whose names imply a broad specificity for a given enzyme.  These nonspecific substrates are often involved in multiple reactions.  Exceptions and addendums to activity will be included in the comments on the reaction frame.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biomass-Compositions
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.

UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.

TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the
/corresponding protein.  Relevant regulatory mechanisms include those that directly interfere with or facilitate the translation process,
/as well as those involving processing of the mRNA transcript to promote or inhibit its degradation before translation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Gene-Products
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Binding-Features
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - MIGS-Info
TYPES - PGDB-Metadata
COMMENT - This class stores meta-information about the genome and its origin, loosely based on the attributes specified by the MIGS (Minimal Information about Genome Sequences)
/standard.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Conditions
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe the environmental conditions under which some set of data was collected.  These instances can be supplied as the value of the CONDITIONS
/annotation for environment-specific slots such as TRANSCRIPT-COPY-NUMBER.  The growth conditions that can be specified include temperature, pH, aerobicity, growth-media
/and gene knockouts (although the wildtype organism is assumed by default).  Any description of environmental conditions that cannot be captured via these slots should be
/described using the COMMENT slot. It is not necessary to specify a growth-status.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and TCA cycle), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Propeptides
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - The part of a protein that is proteolytically cleaved during the protein's
/maturation, e.g. the internal residues of proinsulin, the N-terminal residues of

UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.

COMMON-NAME - Reactions Classified By Conversion Type
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified by the type of 
/transition that occurs, whether by a change in covalent bonding, by a  weak binding interaction,
/or via a complex multistep process, etc.  This reaction ontology is orthogonal to the classification 
/of reactions by substrate classes, that is, many reactions will have parents in both ontologies.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-IC-ADJ-GENES-SAME-BIO-PROCESS
TYPES - EV-IC
COMMON-NAME - Products of adjacent genes in the same biological process
COMMENT - A transcription unit is inferred because there is a set of adjacent genes,

/same metabolic pathway or biological process. Sometimes, these genes code
/for subunits of the same protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-HYPO
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Author hypothesis
COMMENT - Author hypothesis. The hypothesis is in a publication, but it was clearly indicated in the

UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-TAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement
COMMENT - Traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,
/but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported
/the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.
/In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,
/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.

COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement to experimental support
COMMENT - Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  However, the statement did reference another publication describing an experiment 
/that supports the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS

COMMON-NAME - Inferred from genetic interaction
COMMENT - IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> "Traditional" genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.
/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,
/process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B
/using IGI).

UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

TYPES - mRNA-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines regions on mRNA transcripts to which other objects, such as regulatory proteins or complementary sRNAs, bind.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).
/
//

/extended polypeptides on the cytoplasmic and external or vesicular sides.
/Receptor and ion channels have between one and twelve such domains.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Modified-Residues
TYPES - Amino-Acid-Sites
COMMENT - A site on a polypeptide in which a single residue is covalently modified.  Most subclasses
/of this class uniquely specify what the precise modification is (e.g. phosphorylation, methylation,
/etc.).  For cases in which the modification is known but cannot be uniquely specified using a 
/subclass (because it is not practical to define such a subclass), the compound structure slots
/(e.g. STRUCTURE-ATOMS, STRUCTURE-BONDS, etc.) can be used to supply the chemical 
/structure of the modified residue.
//
UNIQUE-ID - All-Genes
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - The class All-Genes includes as its subclasses the set of true genes (class Genes), as
/well as sets of gene-like sequences.  The latter includes class Phantom-Genes
/(sequences that were predicted to be genes by computational gene-finding
/programs, but that were later determined not to be genes, such as through
/experimentation),  and class Pseudo-Genes.    Therefore, to enumerate all true
/genes in an organism, query the instances of class Genes, not class All-Genes.

UNIQUE-ID - Zn-Finger-Regions
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is
/a limited and local parallel of DNA and protein sequences, the occurrence of the
/contacting amino acid residues in the protein sequence falls into a regularity, or
/register, that creates in the protein a syllabicity. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transit-Peptides
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - In the case of post-translationally imported mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins(synthesized in the cytoplasm), an amino terminal
/sequence which contains targeting information and is removed during or shortly after import into the organelles.

/Superpathways can have individual reactions as their components in addition to
/other pathways.  Superpathways can be defined recursively, that is, the

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a tunicamycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-5242 Tunicamycin| is a mixture of nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial teichoic acid and peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the steps of |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.33|, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.13|, respectively. Tunicamycins cannot be used clinically since they are also acive against the eukaryotic enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.15|, which is involved in an early step of protein <i>N</i>-glycosylation. The compounds bind specifically to the active site of the enzymes, blocking their activity and terminating the biosynthesis of the polymers at the first commited step |CITS: [ 444447]|.
/
/The first tunicamycin compound was originally isolated in 1957 under the name mycospocidin |CITS: [13513523]| (it was eventually shown to be a tunicamycin |CITS: [Tkacz78]|). A few years later more tunicamycin compounds were isolated from cultures of |FRAME: TAX-1079983|, this time under the name tunicamycin, and initially described as anti-viral agents, although they were subsequently shown to be also active against yeasts, fungi and Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5572750]|. Tunicamycins were subsequently isolated from |FRAME: TAX-1901| |CITS: [468729]| and |FRAME: TAX-1969|, in which they accumulate to much higher concentrations. The process for tunicamycin preparation was patented 1980 with |FRAME: TAX-1079985| |CITS: [Hamill80]|.
/
/All tunicamycins contain |FRAME: URACIL|, |FRAME: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine|, a unique 11-carbon 2-aminodialdose called |FRAME: CPD-19359|, and a fatty acid linked to the amino group of the tunicamine. The various members of the tunicamycin group, all of which appear to have antimicrobial activity, differ only in the structure of their fatty acyl chain |CITS: [Takatsuki77]|.

COMMON-NAME - a dolichyl diphosphate
COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: DOLICHOLP "Dolichyl phosphate"| acts as a membrane-bound carrier in the assembly of pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides. It can accept the respective sugar residues from the donors |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD-12575| and |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|. When the complete oligosaccharide is transferred to a protein L-asparagine residue, |FRAME: CPD-224| is produced. It can be converted back to |FRAME: DOLICHOLP| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.43|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol diphosphate, containing 16 isoprene units.

COMMON-NAME - compound I
COMMENT - |FRAME: Compound-0 "Compound 0"|, |FRAME: Compound-I|, and |FRAME: Compound-II| are the names given to intermediate states of the heme-iron center that is formed at the active sites of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and peroxidases during catalysis.
/
/<b>I. Cytochrome P-450</b>
/
/In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.
/
/Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from
/the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).
/
/After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.
/
/Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.
/When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.
/
/At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.
/
/<b>II. preoxidases</b>
/
/In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.
/
/In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Respiration
TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMENT - This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
/both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a
/source of energy.
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside
/the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

UNIQUE-ID - Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins (|FRAME: EC-1.11.1.15 "EC 1.11.1.15"|) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center. The four types are:
/
/1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these peroxiredoxins contain two conserved cysteines and are homodimeric enzymes where the two subunits interact in the catalytic cycle and are linked via a disulfide bond in the oxidized form. Eukaryotic 2-Cys proxiredoxins, which are exclusively localized in the chloroplast, are also shown to regulate H2O2-mediated signal transduction |CITS: [9263459]|.
/
/2. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine and are preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.
/
/3. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| (also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these can use thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as the reductant and can exist in multiple isoforms localized in plants in many subcellular compartments, including one form in plastids |CITS: [12913160]|.
/
/4. |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins| ((also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these are homologues of the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migrating protein and function as monomers |CITS: [10998352]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxyhemoglobins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxyhemoglobin
COMMENT - An oxyhemoglobin is |FRAME: Hemoglobins| with bound oxygen. The oxygen is in a |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| state, with a charge of -1, while the hemoglobin iron is in an oxidized +3 state.
/
/The iron is located at the center of a |FRAME: Heme-b| group, and is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.
/
/When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.

TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein
COMMENT - |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "[Fe-S] cluster scaffold proteins"| act as a scaffold on which the [Fe-S] clusters are assembled and from which the clusters are delivered to various apoproteins.
/This type of proteins is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (in the mitochondria) and serves similar functions in all organisms.
/
/Initial studies performed with the IscU [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein from |FRAME: TAX-2336| suggested that the protein exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two distinct conformations |CITS: [12909018][14688265]|. Further studies conducted with the |FRAME: G7324 "<i>apo</i>-IscU"| of |FRAME: TAX-562| showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between a structured (S) and |FRAME: D-form-FeS-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "disordered"| (D) state |CITS: [19492851]|. The D-state of <i>apo</i>-IscU is the substrate for the |FRAME: CPLX0-248 "IscS cysteine desulfurase"|, which transfer sulfur atoms from L-cysteine molecules to cysteine residues of IscU |CITS: [22203963]|. Upon the addition of iron atoms, a [2Fe-2S] cluster forms on the scaffold protein. The cluster is transferred to other proteins via the action of chaperons, such as HscB and HscA |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis co-chaperone]
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

COMMENT - CAAX proteins are eukaryotic proteins that terminate with a CAAX motif (C = cysteine, A = generally an aliphatic residue, X = one of a few amino acids) that undergo three ordered post-translational maturation events referred to as CAAX  processing. These events are: covalent attachment of an isoprenoid lipid (farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) to the cysteine (|FRAME: EC-2.5.1.58|), proteolytic removal of the AAX tripeptide (|FRAME: EC-3.4.24.84|), and carboxyl methylesterification of the newly exposed COOH-terminal prenylcysteine (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.100|).

COMMON-NAME - a nitrile
COMMENT - Nitriles are <b>organic</b> compounds that contain a functional group of a carbon atom linked by a triple bond to a nitrogen atom (known as a cyano group). Inorganic compounds that contain the cyano group are not called nitriles, but cyanides.
/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-1.9.3.1|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.
/
/Nitriles occur naturally in many organisms, and over 120 naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated. It is particularly common in fruit seeds. The cyano group is very stable and is not readily metabolized.

TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthase
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic acid-free at the protein level. The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by protein templates, and each biosynthetic step generally requires a protein module. A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes |CITS: [15487945]|.

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis chaperone]-ATP
COMMENT - This entry describes the ATP-bound form of |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones|.
/
/Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: DOLICHOLP "Dolichyl phosphate"| acts as a membrane-bound carrier in the assembly of pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides. It can accept the respective sugar residues from the donors |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD-12575| and |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol phosphate, containing 16 isoprene units.

COMMON-NAME - compound II
COMMENT - |FRAME: Compound-0 "Compound 0"|, |FRAME: Compound-I|, and |FRAME: Compound-II| are the names given to intermediate states of the heme-iron center that is formed at the active sites of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and peroxidases during catalysis.
/
/<b>I. Cytochrome P-450</b>
/
/In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.
/
/Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from
/the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).
/
/After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.
/
/Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.
/When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.
/
/At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.
/
/<b>II. preoxidases</b>
/
/In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.
/
/In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.

UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

COMMON-NAME - compound 0
COMMENT - |FRAME: Compound-0 "Compound 0"|, |FRAME: Compound-I|, and |FRAME: Compound-II| are the names given to intermediate states of the heme-iron center that is formed at the active sites of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and peroxidases during catalysis.
/
/<b>I. Cytochrome P-450</b>
/
/In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.
/
/Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from
/the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).
/
/After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.
/
/Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.
/When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.
/
/At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.
/
/<b>II. preoxidases</b>
/
/In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.
/
/In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - compound III
COMMENT - |FRAME: Compound-0 "Compound 0"|, |FRAME: Compound-I|, and |FRAME: Compound-II| are the names given to intermediate states of the heme-iron center that is formed at the active sites of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and peroxidases during catalysis.
/
/<b>I. Cytochrome P-450</b>
/
/In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.
/
/Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from
/the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).
/
/After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.
/
/Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.
/When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.
/
/At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.
/
/<b>II. preoxidases</b>
/
/In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.
/
/In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the

/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.

UNIQUE-ID - CAPSULAR-POLYSACCHARIDES
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a capsular polysaccharide
COMMENT - Polysaccharide capsules are ubiquitous structures found on the cell surface of a broad range of bacterial species. They are thick, mucous-like, layers of polysaccharides that form a cap around the bacterial surface.They are an important factor in the virulence of many animal and plant pathogens, where they protect the bacteria from opsonophagocytosis and complement-mediated killing by the host.
/
/Capsular polysaccharides are linear and consist of regularly repeating subunits of one to six monosaccharides. They have molecular weights on the order of 100-2000 kDa, and are linked to the cell surface of the bacterium via covalent attachments to phospholipids, lipid-A molecules, or peptidoglycan. The composition allows for a remarkable variability - over 80 different capsular polysaccharides (also known as K antigens) have been described for |FRAME: TAX-562| alone.
/
/Capsular polysaccharides are highly hydrated, and consist of over 95% water. 
/
/Biosynthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides is a complex process. In Gram-negative bacteria the activated precursors (nucleotide monophospho and diphospho sugars) are assembled in the cytoplasm into the nascent polysaccharide by enzymes associated with the inner membrane, and while attached to the membrane by an undecaprenyl membrane anchor. A dedicated translocation pathway moves the nascent polymer through the periplasm and across the outer membrane to the cell surface, where it is removed from the membrane anchor and attached to the core oligosacchride of lipid A.

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - cyanophycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cyanophycin Cyanophycin| is an amino acid polymer that is found in most cyanobacteria. It is a high-molecular weight copolymer, composed of an |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| backbone and |FRAME: ARG| side groups, with typical size of  25-100 kDa. The arginine moieties are linked to the &beta;-carboxyl group of each aspartate by its &alpha;-amino group.
/
/Cyanophycin is largely insoluble under physiological conditions and is accumulated in the form of granules in the cytoplasm during phosphate or sulfur starvation, generally in the early and mid-stationary phase |CITS: [16591901]|.
/
/The polymer serves as a temporary nitrogen reserve, which accumulates during the transition from the exponential- to the stationary-growth phase and disappears when balanced growth resumes.
/
/Even though cyanophycin is considered largely exclusive for cyanobacteria, it is also found in a few heterotrophic bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-62977| |CITS: [11976746][15289556]|.

COMMENT - Steroids are compounds possessing the skeleton of cyclopenta[<i>a</i>]phenanthrene or a skeleton derived
/therefrom by one or more bond scissions or ring expansions or contractions. Methyl groups are normally present
/at C-10 and C-13. An alkyl side chain may also be present at C-17.
/
/Steroids are abundant in the environment. Large amounts of steroids and their derivatives are synthesized by eukaryotes, and these molecules play very important and diverse roles and include hormones, detergents that facilitate the absorption of lipids by the intestine, and membrane constituents. Some of them, |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| and related compounds, are ubiquitous as membrane constituent of eukaryotes (for instance, up to 10% of the dry mass of yeast is |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL|) and as the precursors of all steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids.
/
/Interestingly, with exception of methane-oxidizing bacteria that contain relatively large amounts of sterols, sterols are absent from most prokaryotes. However, many bacterial membranes contain |FRAME: Hopanoids hopanoids|, which are similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules |CITS: [18039763]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

/
/Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and for vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein |FRAME: Opsins opsin| to form the light-absorbing molecule rhodopsin (see |FRAME: PWY-6861|).
/
/Vitamin A, in the form of retinoic acid, is also an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.

COMMENT - Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation.
/These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.
/
/There are also several synthetic forms-   vitamin K<sub>3</sub> through K<sub>9</sub>. Vitamin K<sub>3</sub> (|FRAME: CPD-3766|) is the most active of the synthetic forms.

In addition, the &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species of both compound groups vary in the methylation pattern of the chromanol ring |CITS:[12897790]|.
/
/Vitamin E compounds are synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms, although they are essential dietary components for animals (including humans), where they act primarily as antioxidants. Their presumed role in plants involve protection of chloroplast lipids and chlorophylls against oxidative damages. The tocotrienols are mostly found in monocots |CITS:[Padley94]| and a few dicots |CITS:[17110122]|, whereas tocopherols are wider spread in the plant kingdom and dominate in the dicots |CITS:[8827691]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

COMMON-NAME - a methyl group donor
COMMENT - |FRAME: Methyl-Acceptors "A methyl group donor"| is a compound that can donate a methyl group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.1.1 methyltransferase group"|.
/Prior to donating the methyl group the compound is |FRAME: Methylated-methyl-acceptors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Demethylated-methyl-acceptors|.
/
/Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome
COMMENT - Cytochromes are proteins containing |FRAME: Hemes| groups and are primarily involved in electron transport.
/They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.
/
/In general cytochromes are named based on the type of heme they carry - cytochrome <i>c</i> contains a heme <i>c</i>, while cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> contains both a heme <i>a</i> and a heme <i>a</i><sub>3</sub>. Often cytochromes are further designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt <i>c</i><sub>559</sub>.
/
/In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and its oxidized state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>). Thus, cytochromes are reduced by accepting an electron from a donor, and deliver the electron to the oxidized form of an acceptor, reducing it in the process. Cytochromes play an indispensable role in most respiratory chains and in photosynthesis.

UNIQUE-ID - N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE
TYPES - Amino-Sugars
TYPES - CPD-1119
COMMON-NAME - <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate
COMMENT - Sialic acids are an important family of related 9-carbon sugars acids, present on the surface of many different cells and functioning in a wide range of different biological processes.
/
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
/animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
/microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
/system.
/
/N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 
/
/A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

COMMENT - Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced by some bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
/Polyketides are usually biosynthesized by polyketide synthase enzymes (PKS) through the decarboxylative condensation of extender units that are derived from malonyl-CoA, in a process similar to fatty acid synthesis.
/
/PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: Lactones "lactone"| is a cyclic ester, the product of condensation of an alcohol group and a carboxylate group
/within the same molecule. It is characterized by a closed ring consisting of two or more carbon atoms and a single oxygen atom, with a ketone group in one of the carbons adjacent to the ring oxygen.
/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.
/
/The name lactone is derived from the lactone of |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, which is called
/|FRAME: CPD-9549|, although it is really a di-lactone.

/
/Poly (HA SCL) are formed from hydroxy fatty acids with short chain lengths of three to five carbon atoms.
/
/Poly (HA MCL) are formed from hydroxy fatty acids with medium chain lengths of six to 14 carbon atoms.

UNIQUE-ID - ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Anaerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which

/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,

/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside
/the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.

UNIQUE-ID - Sulfurylated-ThiI
TYPES - Polypeptides
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>S</i>-sulfanyl-[ThiI sulfur-carrier protein]
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Myosin-Actin
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a myosin-actin complex
COMMENT - Myosins are ATP-dependent motor proteins that are able to move along actin filaments. Most myosin molecules are composed of a head, neck, and tail domain. 
/
/Each myosin motor protein possesses ATPase activity,  and functions in a cyclical manner that couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to conformational changes in the protein. The steps involved are as follows:
/
/1.  Myosin is attached to the actin filament in a conformation known as the "rigor state".
/
/2. ATP binding to the myosin head domain causes the release of the actin filament and a large conformational shift in the neck domain of myosin that bends the myosin head into a position further along the actin filament.
/
/3.  ATP is hydrolyzed, but both the inorganic phosphate and ADP remain bound to myosin.
/
/4.  The myosin head makes weak contact with the actin filament and the inorganic phosphate is released.
/
/5.  The release of the inorganic phosphate reinforces the binding interaction between myosin and actin, and simultaneously cuases the myosin protein to revert to its original conformation. The combined effect of these changes is a relative movement between the two proteins, known as the "power stroke". This is the key force-generating step used by myosin motor proteins.
/
/6.  As myosin regains its original conformation, the ADP is released.

UNIQUE-ID - Hydrogenases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.
/
/In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Holo-malonate-decarboxylases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - [a <i>holo</i> malonate decarboxylase acyl-carrier-protein]
COMMENT - Several strains of bacteria are able to utilize malonate as sole source of carbon and energy. The key reaction in the pathway is the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate, which is catalyzed by malonate decarboxylase. Malonate is a rather inert compound, and its decarboxylation under physiological conditions requires an activation step, in which malonate forms a thioester derivative.
/
/Malonate decarboxylase is an enzyme complex composed of three subunits, one of which is a dedicated acyl-carrier protein (acp). The acp protein is synthesized in an <i>apo</i> form, and is converted to its <i>holo</i> form by the covalent binding of the prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to a serine residue. This prosthetic group is very unusual and the only other enzyme known to use it is |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| (see |FRAME: P2-PWY|).

UNIQUE-ID - Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a [co-chaperone]-[scaffold protein-(2Fe-2S)] complex
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

/Prior to donating the amino group the compound is |FRAME: Aminated-Amine-Donors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Deaminated-Amine-Donors|.
/
/Since tranmination reactions are reversible, the distinction between an amino group donor and an amino group acceptor is not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds, such as |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, are often used as amino group donors by the aminotransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/This particular entry is used when the identity of the amino group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: EC-2.7.12.2 "EC 2.7.12.2"|, |FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzymes also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.25 "EC 2.7.11.25"|,  MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

(e.g., poison oak, poison ivy, poison sumac). The urushiols consist of a catechol substituted with an alkyl chain that has 15 or 17 carbon atoms that may be saturated or unsaturated. Most plants have a mixture of several compounds, and the exact composition varies depending on the plant souce
/
/Urushiols cause an allergic skin rash on contact, with the likelihood and severity of allergic reaction dependent on the degree of unsaturation of the alkyl chain.
/
/Urushiol is an oleoresin. After injury to the plant it leaks to the surface where it contacts oxygen. The oxidation and polymerization of urushiol in the tree's sap in the presence of moisture allows it to form a hard lacquer, which is used to produce traditional Chinese and Japanese lacquerware. The name comes from kiurushi, the Japanese name for the lacquer produced in East Asia from the sap of |FRAME: TAX-4013| (the Lacquer Tree).

COMMENT - Bacteriochlorophylls are photosynthetic light harvesting pigments found in photosynthetic bacteria.

In addition, while most of the bacteriochlorophylls contain a |FRAME: MG+2| ion, there are varieties that contain a |FRAME: ZN+2| ion |CITS: [Wakao96]|.
/
/Most of the bacteria that synthesize bacteriochlorophyll are anoxygenic species that belong to the proteobacteria. They are also known as purple bacteria, due to the color of the pigment. These species photosynthesize only under anaerobic conditions. However, bacteriochlorophylls are also present in some groups of aerobic bacteria, such as members of the Acidiphilium genus |CITS: [Wakao93]|. For a complete list of aerobic bacteria that contain bacteriochlorophyll, see |CITS: [12483616]|. Much of the knowledge about bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis comes from the organisms |FRAME: TAX-1061| and |FRAME: TAX-1063|, which produce mainly |FRAME:CPD-9067|, the most common form of the bacteriochlorophylls.

TYPES - Chlorins
COMMON-NAME - a bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>
COMMENT - Green sulfur bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-191412|) and green flimentous bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-1106|) contain chlorosomes - large organelles that are believed to be the most efficient light-harvesting antennae in nature |CITS: [20130996][Saga10]|. Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.
/
/Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 1030 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.
/
/The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C-3<sup>1</sup> position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C-13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-13<sup>2</sup>-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.
/
/Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.
/
/In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-8<sup>2</sup> and C-12<sup>1</sup> carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-8<sup>2</sup> position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions. 
/
/Most of the green sulfur bacteria growing in stratified lakes contain |FRAME:CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"|. |FRAME:CPD-9094 "Bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| has been isolated from the chlorosomes of several strains of brown-colored |FRAME: TAX-191412|, including |FRAME: TAX-34090| and |FRAME: TAX-1096| |CITS: [12029393]|.

COMMON-NAME - a bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>
COMMENT - Green sulfur bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-191412|) and green flimentous bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-1106|) contain chlorosomes - large organelles that are believed to be the most efficient light-harvesting antennae in nature |CITS: [20130996][Saga10]|. Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.
/
/Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 1030 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.
/
/The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C3<sup>1</sup> position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-13<sup>2</sup>-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.
/
/Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.
/
/In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-8<sup>2</sup> and C-12<sup>1</sup> carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-8<sup>2</sup> position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions.

/This type of proteins is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (in the mitochondria) and serves similar functions in all organisms.
/
/Initial studies performed with the IscU [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein from |FRAME: TAX-2336| suggested that the protein exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two distinct conformations |CITS: [12909018][14688265]|. Further studies conducted with the |FRAME: G7324 "<i>apo</i>-IscU"| of |FRAME: TAX-562| showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between a structured (S) and |FRAME: D-form-FeS-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "disordered"| (D) state |CITS: [19492851]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Phospho-MEK
TYPES - Polypeptides
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: EC-2.7.12.2 "EC 2.7.12.2"|, |FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzymes also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.25 "EC 2.7.11.25"|,  MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

UNIQUE-ID - Rhodopsins

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013]|. 
/
/When a photon is absorbed by the retinal chromophore, it isomerizes from |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| (while bound to the protein) and induces a conformational change in the opsin. In mammalian cells this process is known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations: 
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and binding of the protein arrestin. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and |FRAME: Aporhodopsins opsin| |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607][8639666]|.
/
/The retinal chromophore is connected to the protein via a Schiff base (a double bond between a carbon in the chromophore to a nitrogen in a lysine residue of opsin) |CITS: [Harosi95]|. The structure shown here is a generic representation, as not all rhodopsins utilize this particular form of retinal.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxins are small redox proteins known to be present in nearly all organisms and function in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxins have a characteristic tertiary structure known as the thioredoxin fold, and contain two vicinal cysteines in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines form the cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site, and allow thioredoxin to reduce other proteins.
/
/The thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|, which utilizes NADPH as the electron source. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates. In addition, thioredoxins can also act as electron donors to certain proteins, such as the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|.
/
/|FRAME: Glutaredoxins Glutaredoxins| share many of the functions of thioredoxins, but are reduced by glutathione rather than a specific reductase. 
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

/
/The protein complex shares a considerable degree of similarity with the MoFe protein of nitrogenase (|FRAME: NifDK NifDK|).

/
/The resulting M-cluster is then relocated from the surface to the binding site within NifEN. In the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-354| the M-cluster is held in its new place by interactions with Cys250 and Asn418, and the homocitrate is anchored by interactions with Arg402.

UNIQUE-ID - NifB-with-L-cluster
TYPES - Polypeptides
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a NifB protein with an L-cluster
COMMENT - NifB is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of the |FRAME: CPD-41| of [MoFe]-nitrogenases, and contains the CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C motif characteristic of the radical SAM superfamily. Sequence analysis suggested that in addition to a radical SAM [4Fe-4S] cluster, NifB contains two other |FRAME: CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|. It is now known to catalyze the condensation of these two clusters into a single |FRAME: CPD-18407|, inserting a carbide atom at the center of the molecule |CITS: [23019652][25477518]|.
/
/Early attempts at characterizing a His-tagged form of NifB from |FRAME: TAX-354| were unsuccessful due to the extreme instability of NifB in aqueous solutions. The problem was circumvented by creating a fusion between NifB and NifN, resulting in successful isolation of a NifE(N-B) complex |CITS: [21551100]|. It should be noted that such a fusion occurs naturally in the bactrerium |FRAME: TAX-1501|.
/
/The NifE(N-B) complex was fully active as a |FRAME: CPD-41| donor for a cofactor-deficient MoFe protein (the dinitrogenase component of [MoFe]-nitrogenase enzymes). Metal, activity, ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses established the presence of two transient clusters, designated K-cluster and |FRAME: CPD-18407|, respectively, on the NifEN-B fusion protein. The K-cluster was found to consist of a pair of [4Fe-4S] clusters, while the L-cluster is a [8Fe-9S-C] cluster |CITS: [16423898][21726031][21212358]|.
/
/The fusion protein was overexpressed in |FRAME: TAX-354| in the presence of all accessory proteins except the nitrogenase components (NifH and NifDK). In the absence of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| cluster maturation was halted at the NifB state. Upon addition of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|, the EPR signal of [4Fe-4S] clusters was replaced by the signal of the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster. In addition, both both |FRAME: CH33ADO| and |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| were formed during the reaction. Thus, it has been established that NifB utilizes two molecules of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|.

COMMON-NAME - a NifB protein with a K-cluster
COMMENT - NifB is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of the |FRAME: CPD-41| of [MoFe]-nitrogenases, and contains the CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C motif characteristic of the radical SAM superfamily. Sequence analysis suggested that in addition to a radical SAM [4Fe-4S] cluster, NifB contains two other |FRAME: CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|. It is now known to catalyze the condensation of these two clusters into a single |FRAME: CPD-18407|, inserting a carbide atom at the center of the molecule |CITS: [23019652][25477518]|.
/
/Early attempts at characterizing a His-tagged form of NifB from |FRAME: TAX-354| were unsuccessful due to the extreme instability of NifB in aqueous solutions. The problem was circumvented by creating a fusion between NifB and NifN, resulting in successful isolation of a NifE(N-B) complex |CITS: [21551100]|. It should be noted that such a fusion occurs naturally in the bactrerium |FRAME: TAX-1501|.
/
/The NifE(N-B) complex was fully active as a |FRAME: CPD-41| donor for a cofactor-deficient MoFe protein (the dinitrogenase component of [MoFe]-nitrogenase enzymes). Metal, activity, ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses established the presence of two transient clusters, designated K-cluster and |FRAME: CPD-18407|, respectively, on the NifEN-B fusion protein. The K-cluster was found to consist of a pair of [4Fe-4S] clusters, while the L-cluster is a [8Fe-9S-C] cluster |CITS: [16423898][21726031][21212358]|.
/
/The fusion protein was overexpressed in |FRAME: TAX-354| in the presence of all accessory proteins except the nitrogenase components (NifH and NifDK). In the absence of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| cluster maturation was halted at the NifB state. Upon addition of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|, the EPR signal of [4Fe-4S] clusters was replaced by the signal of the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster. In addition, both both |FRAME: CH33ADO| and |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| were formed during the reaction. Thus, it has been established that NifB utilizes two molecules of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|.

/
/|FRAME:SOXYDENIT-MONOMER| combines with |FRAME:SOXZDENIT-MONOMER|, a sulfur compound chelating protein, to form the |FRAME:CPLX-881| complex. A thiosulfate ion can be transferred the free thiol group of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys138) of |FRAME:SOXYDENIT-MONOMER| to form |FRAME: SoxY-Thiocysteine-Sulfate|, the first covalently bound sulfur adduct in the sulfur oxidation pathway of |FRAME: TAX-82367|. The reaction is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-7149| complex |CITS: [14651972]|.

COMMON-NAME - an opsin
COMMENT - The opsin proteins are the retinal-binding visual pigments found in the photoreceptor cells in the retinas of mammalian eyes.
/An opsin is arranged into a bundle of seven transmembrane &alpha;-helices connected by six loops. In rod cells the opsin molecules are embedded in the membranes of the disks which are entirely inside of the cell.  In cone cells the disks are defined by the cell's plasma membrane so that the N-terminus head extends outside of the cell. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-881| binds covalently to a lysine on the transmembrane helix nearest the C-terminus of opsin through a Schiff base linkage. Formation of the Schiff base linkage involves removing the oxygen atom from retinal and two hydrogen atoms from the free amino group of lysine, releasing a water molecule.
/
/While mammals use retinal exclusively as the opsin chromophore, other groups of animals additionally use four chromophores closely related to retinal, including (3,4)-didehydroretinal (many fish and amphibians), (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal (most insects), (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal (Cyclorrhaphans), and (4R)-4-hydroxyretinal (Firefly squid).

UNIQUE-ID - Malonate-Decarboxylases-Malonyl-Form
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a malonyl-[<i>holo</i> malonate decarboxylase acyl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - Several strains of bacteria are able to utilize malonate as sole source of carbon and energy. The key reaction in the pathway is the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate, which is catalyzed by malonate decarboxylase. Malonate is a rather inert compound, and its decarboxylation under physiological conditions requires an activation step, in which malonate forms a thioester derivative.
/
/Malonate decarboxylase is an enzyme complex composed of three subunits, one of which is a dedicated acyl-carrier protein (acp). The acp protein is synthesized in an <i>apo</i> form, and is converted to its <i>holo</i> form by the covalent binding of the prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to a serine residue. This prosthetic group is very unusual and the only other enzyme known to use it is |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| (see |FRAME: P2-PWY|).

TYPES - Polypeptides
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a HypE hydrogenase maturation protein-S-cyanate
COMMENT - HypE is one of the hydrogenase maturation proteins required for the assembly of the CN ligand of the NiFe metal center of hydrogenases 1, 2 and 3.  
/
/At least seven gene products are involved in the maturation of hydrogenases in |FRAME: TAX-562|, which includes the generation and incorporation of the CN ligand from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| (CP). First, HypF converts CP and ATP to |FRAME: CPD-15424|, inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, and AMP |CITS: [12377778]|. It then transfers the carbamoyl group to the carboxy terminal cysteine of HypE |CITS: [12586941]|. During the carbamoyl transfer reaction, HypE and HypF form a tight stoichiometric complex |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE then catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis-dependent dehydration of the carbamate group to a cyanate group |CITS: [15291820][12586941]| which is transferred to the HypC-HypD complex |CITS: [15504408]| and from there to the hydrogenase.
/
/Purified HypE displays low intrinsic ATPase activity |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE can form a homodimer via a disulfide bridge formed by the C-terminal cysteine residue. It is unclear whether the disulfide-bridged dimer has biological significance |CITS: [15291820]|. A crystal structure of apo-HypE from <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 has been solved at 2 &Aring; resolution, and a reaction mechanism has been proposed |CITS: [18065529]|.

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,

/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - SAMP
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a small archaeal modifier protein
COMMENT - Small archaeal modifier proteins (SAMPs) are ubiquitin-like proteins that are covalently attached to proteins in archaea. Like ubiquitin, these proteins possess a &beta;-grasp fold and carboxy-terminal diglycine motif, and as in ubiquitinylation, the C-terminal carboxylate forms an isopeptide bond with the &epsilon;-amino group of lysine residues on target proteins |CITS: [20054389]|. In addition, it has been shown that the C-terminal glycine of SAMP2 can form a bond with Lys 58 of SAMP2 itself, forming poly-SAMP chains, as in the case of polyubiquitinylation. The process of modification by SAMP has been termed SAMPylation.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyketide-ACP-Proteins
TYPES - Polyketide-Synthases
TYPES - All-ACPs
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide synthase containing an [acp] domain
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are found in soil and marine filamentous bacteria, as well as in fungi and higher plants, and are responsible for producing such therapeutically important natural products as erythromycin and lovastatin. Analogous to the fatty acid synthases, PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an ACP. The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their |FRAME: apo-ACP "<i>apo</i> inactive form"|, and are activated by attachment of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to an |FRAME: SER| residue, in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7| (4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase) |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

COMMENT - The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (also called ubiquitin-carrier-proteins, E2 enzymes, or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), perform the second step in the ubiquitination reaction. 
/
/The activity of the enzyme starts with the transfer of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 E1|-ubiquitin complex to a catalytic L-cysteine residue at the active site by transesterification. Once loaded with ubiquitin, the E2 enzyme binds one of several |FRAME: E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins "E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins"| (or E3 enzymes) via a structurally conserved binding region. The E3 enzyme also binds the target protein substrate, and catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 cysteine to a lysine residue on the target protein.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an E3 ubiquitin transferase
COMMENT - E3 ubiquitin-transferases (also called ubiquitin-carrier proteins and incorrectly ubiquitin ligases or E3 ubiquitin ligases) are enzymes that transfer |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from a ubiquitin-|FRAME: Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2 E2| complex to the target protein that is to be ubiquitinated. The enzyme attaches the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein via an isopeptide bond.
/Since no ATP is required for this transfer operation, these enzymes are transferases and not ligases.
/
/E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins are also involved in poly-ubiquitination, building poly-ubiquitin chains by adding a second ubiquitin to the first, a third to the second, and so forth.
/
/Chains can be added to different lysines on the ubiquitin molecule. Chains at different locations result in different fate for the ubiquitinated protein. For example, human proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys48 are targeted to the proteasome for degradation, while proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys63 seem to be important for DNA repair.
/
/E3 ubiquitin-transferases contain a domain for binding the E2-ubiquitin complex and a substrate-specific domain for binding the target protein. Many E2- and substrate-binding domains exist, and depending on these domains the E3 ubiquitin-transferases have been classified into several families. Common families include |FRAME: HECT-E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins HECT| (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) and |FRAME: RING-E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins RING| (Really Interesting New Gene).

COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.

/
/The |FRAME: MONOMER-16054|, |FRAME: MONOMER-16055| and |FRAME: MONOMER-16056| proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of |FRAME: TAX-1049| and found to constitute a soluble &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>&gamma;<sub>2</sub>-structured 75-kDa complex |CITS: [15687204]|.
/
/The three genes were cloned and expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562|, and the recombinant proteins were purified and crystallized |CITS: [17909298][18952098]|.

UNIQUE-ID - DsrC-sulfur-carrier-proteins
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a DsrC sulfur carrier protein
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.

COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.

COMMENT - DNA ligases facilitate the joining of DNA fragments together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond. Most DNA ligases participate in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex DNA, but some forms specifically repair double-strand breaks. In addition to DNA repair, DNA ligase are crucial for DNA replication.
/
/Most DNA ligases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate ends of DNA strands, and require ATP, although some forms require GTP, NAD, or ADP instead of ATP) (see |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.1|, |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.2|, |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.6| and |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.7|).
/
/The reaction proceeds in three steps:
/
/1. Adenylation/guanylylation of a lysine residue in the active center of the enzyme, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate
/
/2. Transfer of the adenylate/guanylate group to the 5' phosphate of the donor strand, forming a temporary A (or G)-5'-pp-5'-(deoxynucleotide)-[DNA] cap.
/
/3. An attack by the 3'-hydroxyl end of the acceptor strand on the A (or G)-5'-pp-5'-(deoxynucleotide)-[DNA] cap, leading to release of the adenylate/guanylate and formation of a phosphodiester bond between the two substrate fragments.

COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-5561 Lovastatin| is a polyketide produced by the fungus |FRAME: TAX-33178|. It is widely prescribed (along with the semisynthetic derivative |FRAME: CPD66-17|) as a hypercholesterolemia drug because of its inhibitory activity towards |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.34| (HMGR).
/
/Two highly reducing iterative type I polyketide synthases play central roles in the biosynthesis of lovastatin acid. The lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS or LovB), together with the dissociated enoylreductase LovC, are responsible for the 
/assembly of |FRAME: CPD-16907|, a key intermediate in the process. This intermediate is then modified by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase LovA through hydroxylation and dehydration to produce |FRAME: CPD-16905|, which is then hydroxylated at C-8 by the same enzyme to produce |FRAME: CPD-16908|.
/
/The process is finalyzed by the synthesis of the &alpha;-methylbutyryl side chain (catalyzed by the lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS or LovF)) and its transfer to the C-8 hydroxy group of monacolin J acid by the acyl transferase LovD.

UNIQUE-ID - Histones
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a histone
COMMENT - Histones are proteins found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells that package and order the nuclear DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. The histones act as spools around which DNA can wind, and play an important role in gene regulation. For example, a human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but when wound around histones, it is compacted into a structure of about 90  &mu;m.
/
/There are five major families of histones: H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, all of which are involved in the formation of a single nucleosome. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (also known as the core histones) assemble to form one octameric nucleosome core particle, around which the DNA wraps in a left-handed super-helical turn. A single molecule of histone H1 (known as the linker histone) then binds to the nucleosome, locking the DNA in place.
/
/Two higher-order structures involving multiple nucleosomes are formed -  a 30 nm fiber (forming an irregular zigzag) and a 100 nm fiber. The H1 histone also binds to the "linker DNA" (approximately 20-80 nucleotides in length) region between nucleosomes, helping stabilize the zig-zagged 30 nm fiber.
/
/The complex structure of multiple nucleosomes, including the histones and the DNA wrapped around them, is known as chromatin.

COMMON-NAME - 50S ribosomal subunit protein L16
COMMENT - The L16 protein is a late assembly component of the 50S subunit of the ribosome; ribosomes lacking L16 are translationally active |CITS: [2204629]|.  L2 is required for assembly of L16 into the 50S subunit |CITS: [2211695]|.
/
/L16 interacts with tRNA |CITS: [6352325][6363130][2182127]| and can be crosslinked to aminoacylated tRNA in the A and P site |CITS: [386278][8524654]|.  Conserved residues within L16 were shown to be involved in the translocation of tRNA from the A to the P site |CITS: [24186064]|.  L16 is located within 21 &Aring; of nucleotide C2475 of 23S rRNA, near the peptidyltransferase center |CITS: [7529559]|.  L16 and a histidine residue within the N-terminal domain of L16 may be important for the correct conformation of the peptidyltransferase center |CITS: [6254759][3549294][3297687]|.  L16 is important for release factor 2-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis |CITS: [6355096]|.  The antibiotics chloramphenicol |CITS: [4365366][4599619]| and virginiamycin S |CITS: [95947]| interact with L16 within the ribosome.
/
/L16 is one of six ribosomal proteins that is completely lost from ribosomes in post-stationary cells |CITS: [6201363]|.

UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Ligases
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an RNA ligase
COMMENT - RNA ligases facilitate the joining of RNA fragments together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond. They participate in repair, splicing and editing pathways that either reseal broken RNAs or alter their primary structure. 
/
/Most RNA ligases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate ends of RNA strands, and require ATP.  They have been divided into two classes on the basis of RNA substrate specificity: Rnl1 enzymes catalyze the joining of broken ends of single-stranded RNA generated by a site-specific RNA endonuclease. Examples include Bacteriophage T4Rnl1, which functions to repair breaks in the anticodon loop of tRNALys |CITS: [4342972]|, and yeast and plants tRNA ligase (Trl1), which participates in intron splicing |CITS: [9582290][15653639]|. Yeast Trl1 is also responsible for nonspliceosomal splicing of mRNA in the unfolded protein response pathway |CITS: [8898194]|.
/
/Rnl2 enzymes repair breaks in double-stranded RNA. While these enzyme are found in all three phylogenetic domains, their biological function is not well understood |CITS: [12228725]|, with the exception of kinetoplastid, where they are involved in altering the translational reading frame of mitochondrial mRNAs by the insertion or removal of uridines |CITS: [11158286]|.
/
/The reaction proceeds in three steps:
/
/1. Adenylation of a lysine residue in the active center of the enzyme, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate
/
/2. Transfer of the adenylate group to the 5' phosphate of one of the substrate (the donor), forming a temporary A-5'-pp-5'-(deoxynucleotide)-[RNA] end.
/
/3. An attack by the 3'-hydroxyl end of the acceptor strand on the App-(deoxynucleotide)-[RNA] end, leading to release of the adenylate and formation of a phosphodiester bond between the two substrate fragments.

UNIQUE-ID - Suberins
TYPES - Aromatic-Polymers
TYPES - Phenylpropanoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - suberin
COMMENT - Suberin is a polymeric plant cell wall constituent mainly found in the epidermal tissues of underground plant parts. Suberin consists of two domains, a polyaromatic ((poly)hydroxycinnamate domain) and a polyaliphatic domain. The polyaromatics are predominately located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the primary cell wall and the plasmalemma. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. 
/
/The |FRAME: PWY-1121 biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin monomers| shares the same upstream reactions with |FRAME: PWY-321|, and the biosynthesis of suberin aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with lignin biosynthesis. Although both suberin and cutin contain aliphatic monomers, suberin differs from cutin by the chain length of aliphatic monomers, which can range from C16 to C32. 
/
/Some of the major suberin monomers include |FRAME: 18-HYDROXYOLEATE|, |FRAME: OCTADEC-9-ENE-118-DIOIC-ACID|, and |FRAME: CPD-440|, characterized in potato, as well as very long chain aliphatic monomers found in many plants. In addition, |FRAME: 16-HYDROXYPALMITATE|, is a precursor of an important component of aromatic suberin in Arabidopsis  |CITS:[19759341][19846769]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Vitamins-B6 Vitamin B6| is a group term for |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| (PL), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| (PN), |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| (PM) and their 5'-phosphorylated derivatives |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| (PLP), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| (PNP) and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP), which are also referred to as vitamers. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has recently been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|.  Most bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.
/
/PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. In humans this vitamin has a role in numerous functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to potent antioxidant activity.

COMMENT - Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) is a functional analog of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin|, described from members of the |FRAME: TAX-1762|.
/
/Pup essentially serves the same function as |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin|. It attaches to specific lysine residues of substrate proteins by forming isopeptide bonds. This conjugated proteins are recognized by the Mycobacterium proteasomal ATPase (Mpa), which delivers them to the 20S proteasome, coupling ATP hydrolysis with proteasomal degradation.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - [LysW L-2-aminoadipate carrier protein]
COMMENT - LysW is an &alpha;-aminoadipate carrier protein used by many archaebacterial species for the synthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: LYS|. 
/
/The amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, an intermediate in the archaeal L-lysine biosynthetic pathway (which is also found in the hyperthermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-274|), is covalently linked to the &gamma;-carboxyl group of the last C-terminal residue of LysW (Glu54 in |FRAME: TAX-274|) by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5207| gene. LysW not only protects the amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, but also serves as a carrier protein, which is easily recognized by lysine biosynthesis enzymes. In this way all subsequent transformations leading to L-lyine occur when the amino acid is attached to LysW, and the |FRAME: CPD-468| side chain is converted to a C-terminal lysyl side chain in the LysW-conjugated form. Eventually, a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5222| gene releases the mature amino acid |CITS: [19620981]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Phosphatase-2A
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a phosphatase-2A
COMMENT - Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) removes the serine- or threonine-bound phosphate group from a wide range of phosphoproteins. The enzyme is very versatile owing to a large number of regulatory subunits and its ability to interact with numerous other proteins. The PP2A holoenzyme is a dimeric or trimeric protein built up from a catalytic subunit (PP2AC) (catalytic subunit of PP2A), a second constant regulatory subunit, and a third variable subunit. Three major classes of third subunits are currently described. Each of the three subunits of PP2A exists in at least two isoforms, thereby leading to a great variety of possible holoenzyme conformations, all with potential different substrate affinities and catalytic activities.
/
/The common heterodimeric core of the human enzyme consists of |FRAME: HS03696-MONOMER PPP2CA|, a 36 kDa catalytic subunit, and |FRAME: ENSG00000105568-MONOMER PPP2R1A|, a 65 kDa constant regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunit exists as two closely related isoforms designated A&alpha; and A&beta; |CITS: [12370081]|. The dimer can associate with a variety of additional regulatory subunits.

They are particularly abundant in various plant species, but are also found in marine organisms.
/
/The aglycones (glycoside-free portion) of the saponins are termed sapogenins.  They can be any one of a wide variety of polycyclic organic structures originating from the serial addition of ten-carbon terpene units to compose a C30 triterpene skeleton. The number and length of saccharide chains attached to the sapogenin can vary greatly.

COMMENT - Hemoglobin is a protein complex found in the red blood cells of all vertebtrates that is involved in oxygen transport from the lung or gills to the various peripheral tissues. It is also found the tissues of some invertebrates, a homologs of hemoglobin are found in plants and bacteria.
/
/Mammalian hemoglobins are heterotetramers with an &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> composition, and each subunit contains a tightly bound |FRAME: Heme-b| molecule. The iron of the |FRAME: Heme-b| group is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.
/
/When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.
/
/The subunit identity changes with different developmental stages and among different forms of the protein.
/
/In the human fetus, the protein (known as HbF) is composed of of two &alpha; subunits and two &gamma; subunits.
/
/In early embryonic stage the protein (known as hemoglobin Gower-2) is composed of of two &alpha; subunits and two &epsilon; subunits.
/
/In adult hemoglobin A (HbA) the protein is composed of of two &alpha; subunits and two &beta; subunits.
/
/In adult hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) the protein is composed of of two &alpha; subunits and two &delta; subunits.

UNIQUE-ID - Glucosinolates
TYPES - Secondary-Metabolites
COMMON-NAME - a glucosinolate
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucosinolates "Glucosinolates"| are secondary metabolites found in 16 plant families, including agriculturally important crop plants of the |FRAME: TAX-3700| such cabbage, mustard, oilseed rape, and broccoli, as well as the model plant |FRAME: TAX-3702|, and are responsible for the typical sharp taste and odor of these plants.
/
/The glucosinolates are substituted &beta;-thioglucoside <i>N</i>-hydroxysulfates that are formed from any one of eight amino acids, namely, |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, |FRAME: VAL|, |FRAME: LEU|, |FRAME: ILE|, |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: MET|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. Over 115 naturally occurring glucosinolates have been identified. Much of the diversity amongst glucosinolates arises from the addition of different sized alkyl groups to the side chain of the amino acids, principally valine, phenylalanine and methionine |CITS: [18458837]|. They are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic types, depending on whether they are derived from methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan. Indolylmethyl glucosinolates are found mainly in leaves. For a review, see |CITS: [12049923]|.
/
/Glucosinolates are stored in the vacuole and come into contact with the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.147| (myrosinase) upon breakage of the cell. Myrosinase de-glucosylates the glucosinolates, resulting in formation of nitriles, isothiocyanates and thiocyanates. The precise product that is formed depends on the glucosinolate and whether an epithiospecifier protein is present. 
/
/The breakdown products give the typical sharp taste and odor to many of the members of brassicaceae that are eaten, such as raddish and mustard. Arabidopsis has been shown to accumulate at least 23 different glucosinolates in both seeds and leaves.

COMMENT - G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large protein family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses, inside the cell.
/
/G proteincoupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, choanoflagellates,and animals. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change that allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated heterotrimeric G-protein (|FRAME: EC-3.6.5.1 "EC 3.6.5.1"|) by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G protein's &alpha; subunit, together with the bound GTP, dissociates from the &beta; and &gamma; subunits and interact with either intracellular signaling proteins or directly with functional proteins, depending on the &alpha; subunit type.

UNIQUE-ID - Dsb-D
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - DsbD
COMMENT - DsbD is an inner membrane protein that transfers electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the
/periplasmic substrate proteins DsbC, DsbG and CcmG. DsbD consists of three domains: a periplasmic
/N-terminal domain (nDsbD), a central transmembrane (TM) domain (tmDsbD) with eight predicted TM
/helices and a periplasmic C-terminal domain (cDsbD) |CITS: [10760137]|.
/
/The electron cascade is
/initiated by the reduction of tmDsbD by thioredoxin, cDsbD then shuttles electrons from tmDsbD to
/nDsbD and reduced nDsbD passes the electrons onto the periplasmic substrate proteins. It appears that
/unlike DsbB, which has a bound quinone for electron transfer |CITS: [10854438]|, tmDsbD is capable of
/shuffling electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm without involvement of an additional cofactor
/|CITS: [18571669]|. Transfer of electrons across the membrane is thought to occur via thiol disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[12925743], [17641688], [19258316]|.

COMMON-NAME - a ginsenoside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ginsenosides Ginsenosides| or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins found exclusively in the plant genus |FRAME: TAX-4053| (ginseng). They are the principal components responsible for the pharmaceutical activities of ginseng.
/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.
/
/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the
/minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.
/
/Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/
/The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

/
/The MIO group is an electrophile, and reacts with an amino group of the substrate [&alpha;-phenylalanine, &alpha;-tyrosine, or &alpha;-histidine, depending on the enzyme). This interaction facilitates the stereoselective abstraction of one of the C&beta; protons by a nearby tyrosine base located in the lid loop that covers the active site of the enzyme |CITS: [11732994][17185228][17516659][18346767]|. The abstraction of the proton is accompanied, sequentially or simultaneously, by the cleavage of the N-C&alpha; bond and leads to the formation of a product with an unsaturated C&alpha;-C&beta; bond.
/
/The last step depends on the nature of the enzyme. in lyases, the unsaturated product and the amino
/group (as ammonia) are released into the environment |CITS: [5354960]|. In aminomutases the amine group (as a MIO-amine adduct) and the unsaturated product are retained in the active site and the unsaturated product is reaminated and reprotonated at the other C atom |CITS: [15494399 ][18078753][21561099]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Hydride-Acceptors
TYPES - Redox-Electron-Carriers
COMMON-NAME - an unknown electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/This particular entry is used for unknown acceptors that transfer two electrons and two protons.

However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.

/This particular entry is used when the identity of the methyl group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-c
TYPES - Cytochromes
COMMON-NAME - a <i>c</i>-type cytochrome
COMMENT - <i>C</i>-type cytochromes (cytC) are electron-transfer proteins that have one or more |FRAME: HEME_C| groups. They are characterized by the covalent attachment of the heme to the polypeptide chain via two (or rarely one) thioether bonds formed between thiol groups of cysteine residues and vinyl groups of the heme molecule. The two cysteine residues almost always occur in the amino-acid sequence CXXCH |CITS: [10647174]|.
/
/<i>C</i>-type cytochromes possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in <i>c</i>-type cytochromes among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species. The use of the term term "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes" was introduced to distinguish this family of diverse proteins from the well-characterized mitochondrial protein, which is often referred to as "cytochrome <i>c</i>".
/
/Bacterial <i>c</i>-type cytochromes function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 
/
/The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>C</i>-type cytochromes"| have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):
/
/|FRAME: Class-I-Cytochromes-C "Class I"| includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the heme-attachment site towards the N-terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C-terminus. Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome <i>c</i>2, mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i>, split-a-band cytochromes <i>c</i>, cytochrome <i>c</i>8 and cytochrome <i>c</i>5, respectively .
/
/|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C "Class II"| includes the high-spin cytochromes <i>c</i>' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome <i>c</i>-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.
/
/|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C "Class III"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes <i>c</i>3 and <i>c</i>7, with only around thirty residues of amino acid per heme group.
/
/|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C "Class IV"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme <i>c</i>, such as the flavocytochromes <i>c</i> and the cytochromes <i>cd</i>.

COMMON-NAME - a retinoate
COMMENT - Retinoic acids comprise a biologically active form of retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives). The spatiotemporal gradient of RA is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation and the differentiation and organ development.
/
/There are three stereoisomeric forms of retinoic acid: |FRAME: RETINOATE|, |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and |FRAME: CPD-13548|, which show different binding affinities to the retinoic acid receptors. 
/
/|FRAME: RETINOATE| is known to bind exclusively to  the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), whereas |FRAME: CPD-13549| binds to both RARs and  retinoid x-receptors (RXRs). |FRAME: CPD-13548| is naturally generated in the body, yet it has a 100-fold lower affinity to RARs than |FRAME: RETINOATE| or |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and it does not bind to RXRs.

UNIQUE-ID - NRPS-PCP-Proteins
TYPES - Peptidyl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an NRPS containing a [peptidyl-carrier-protein] domain
COMMENT - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are typically polyfunctional modular megasynthases found mainly in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, and participate in assembly line biosynthesis of peptide-based natural products, such as the antibiotic |FRAME: CPD-12245| and the siderophore |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN|.
/The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains.
/
/The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.
/
/PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

COMMON-NAME - a sphingomyelin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

COMMON-NAME - a tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).

UNIQUE-ID - NiFe-hydrogenases
TYPES - Hydrogenases
COMMON-NAME - a [NiFe] hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any [NiFe] hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.

UNIQUE-ID - Methanofurans
TYPES - Coenzymes
COMMON-NAME - a methanofuran
COMMENT - Methanofurans are a group of related carbon-carrier cofactors involved in the first step of the methanogenic reduction of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| (see |FRAME: METHANOGENESIS-PWY|). Methanofurans react with |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| to form the carbamate <i>N</i>-carboxymethanofuran, which is reduced to |FRAME: Formyl-methanofurans| by |FRAME: EC-1.2.99.5|.
/
/In addition, the cofactor also participates at a later stage of all methanogenesis pathways. These pathways converge at the compound |FRAME:Me-CoM|, which is then disproportionated into |FRAME: CH4| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|; the latter process involves methanofuran (see |FRAME: PWY-5209|).
/
/Methanofuran is also used by methylotrophic bacteria as a coenzyme to oxidize formaldehyde to formate |CITS: [9651254][11532013]|.
/
/Methanofurans are the only cofactors known to contain a furan moiety, although furans have been identified in polyketides and fatty acid derived natural products, and are often formed during the heating or oxidation of carbohydrates |CITS: [12013276]|.
/
/The chemical structure of methanofuran varies among different methanogens. At this time (2014) five variants have been characterized:
/|FRAME: CPD-17181| (from |FRAME: TAX-145262|) |CITS: [1517208]|, |FRAME:CPD-7628| (from |FRAME: TAX-2208|) |CITS: [2883935]|, |FRAME:CPD-7629| (from |FRAME: TAX-2173|) |CITS: [3170480]|, |FRAME: methanofuran-d| (from |FRAME: TAX-2190|) |CITS: [24977328]| and |FRAME: CPD-17182| (from |FRAME: TAX-39152|, |FRAME: TAX-2187| and |FRAME: TAX-155863|) |CITS: [25203397]|.
/
/All methanofurans contain the basic core structure of 4-[<i>N</i>-&gamma;-L-glutamyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-<i>p</i>-(&beta;-aminoethyl)phenoxymethyl]-2-(aminomethyl)furan, but with different attached side chains.

UNIQUE-ID - Ferrohemoglobins
TYPES - Hemoglobins
COMMON-NAME - a ferrohemoglobin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferrohemoglobins "Ferrohemoglobin"| is form of |FRAME: Hemoglobins "hemoglobin"| in which the iron in the heme group is in the |FRAME:FE+2| state. This is the active form of the protein that can bind oxygen. Upon binding, the iron is oxidized to |FRAME:FE+3|.
/
/The iron of the |FRAME: Heme-b| group is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring (as is shown in the image). A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.
/
/When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMON-NAME - an oxidized thioredoxin 2
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) was first identified in E. coli. It contains two distinct domains: a C-terminal domain with the conserved WCGPC active site signature and an additional N-terminal domain of 32 residues which includes two conserved CXXC motifs |CITS: [9388228]| responsible for the tight binding of a zinc atom |CITS: [12952960]|.
/
/<i>In vitro</i> studies showed that E. coli Trx2 is a functional Trx, as it is capable of reducing insulin and ribonucleotide reductase and is an electron donor for 3?-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase |CITS: [9388228][10075658]|. <i>In vivo</i>, Trx2 can substitute for Trx1 function, but only when Trx2 is overexpressed.

COMMENT - 
/
/PKS13 is a member of the type I polyketide synthase gene family. Sequence analysis revealed that it contains two non-equivalent phosphopantetheine-binding domains, a ketoacyl synthase domain, an acyl transferase domain, and a thioesterase domain |CITS: [14695899][15653820]|.
/
/PKS13 is involved in the Claisen-type condensation as the final step in the synthesis of mycolic acid in |FRAME: TAX-1773|. The first step of this condensation is the binding of a C52-&alpha;-meroacyl group in  an activated AMP form and a 2-carboxyl-cerotoyl group in its CoA-activated form to an N-terminal [acp] domain and a C-terminal [acp] domain, respectively. The binding reactions are catalyzed by the two  4' phosphopentetheinyl transferase domains.
/
/Following the initial binding, the meroacyl group is transferred from the N-terminal domain to the ketoacyl-synthase (KS) domain in a reaction catalyzed by the acyltransferase domain.
/
/The next step involves the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group of the trans-keto-meroacyl-moiety by the acidic &alpha;-carbon of the 2-carboxyl-cerotoyl-moiety, resulting in the formation of 3-oxo-C87-trans-mycolate bound to the near C-terminal [acp] domain.

UNIQUE-ID - Aporhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013][8639666]|.
/
/The retinal chromophore is connected to the protein via a Schiff base (a double bond between a carbon in the chromophore to a nitrogen in a lysine residue of opsin) |CITS: [Harosi95]|. The structure shown here shows the unmodified L-lysine in <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin.
/
/Isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change in opsin, known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations:  
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and opsin |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607]|.

TYPES - OLIGOPEPTIDES
COMMON-NAME - a peptidoglycan pentapeptide
COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

UNIQUE-ID - Red-Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins-Reduced
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

TYPES - 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Oxidized-ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.

UNIQUE-ID - Ferredoxins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

UNIQUE-ID - 2Fe-2S-proteins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [2Fe-2S] cluster protein
COMMENT - |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins"| contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

COMMON-NAME - a <i>b</i>-type cytochrome
COMMENT - Cytochromes are proteins containing |FRAME: Hemes| groups and are primarily involved in electron transport.
/They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.
/
/<i>b</i>-Type cytochromes contain one or more |FRAME: Heme-b| groups attached to the surrounding protein matrix through a single coordination bond between the heme iron and an amino-acid side-chain. Unlike <i>c</i>-type cytochromes, they lack a covalent bond between the porphyrin ring and the protein.
/
/|FRAME: Heme-b "Heme <i>b</i>"|, whose ferrous form is known as protoheme IX, is the immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways and the most abundant heme form. It is found in common proteins such as  hemoglobin and myoglobin.

COMMENT - Cytochromes are proteins containing |FRAME: Hemes| groups and are primarily involved in electron transport.
/They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.
/
/In general cytochromes are named based on the type of heme they carry - cytochrome <i>c</i> contains a heme <i>c</i>, while cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> contains both a heme <i>a</i> and a heme <i>a</i><sub>3</sub>. Often cytochromes are further designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt <i>c</i><sub>559</sub>.
/
/In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and its oxidized state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>). Thus, cytochromes are reduced by accepting an electron from a donor, and deliver the electron to the oxidized form of an acceptor, reducing it in the process. Cytochromes play an indispensable role in most respiratory chains and in photosynthesis.
/
/The diagram below shows |FRAME: Cytochromes-c|, in which a |FRAME: HEME_C| group is bound to the protein by one or two thioether bonds involving sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. Note that not all cytochromes are covalently attached to their proteins.

UNIQUE-ID - Trimethylamine-corrinoid-proteins
TYPES - Corrinoid-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein
COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.
/
/Reconstitution of |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|-dependent |FRAME:CoM| (CoM) methylation showed that three polypeptides were involved - |FRAME:CPLX-7100|, |FRAME:MONOMER-12207| and |FRAME:MONOMER-12205|.
/
/The first two proteins, of sizes 52 and 26 kDa, respectively, copurified as a single trimethylamine methyltransferase (TMA-MT). Gel permeation of the TMA-MT fraction demonstrated that the 52- kDa methyltransferase eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, suggesting a multimeric structure. The 26-kDa corrinoid protein eluted primarily as a monomer, although a small fraction of it eluted with the 280-kDa peak, indicating that the two proteins weakly associate |CITS: [9006042]|.

UNIQUE-ID - DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE
TYPES - HOLO-CITRATE-LYASE
COMMON-NAME - a [citrate-lyase]
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

UNIQUE-ID - Cellular-Retinol-Binding-Proteins
TYPES - Retinoid-binding-proteins
COMMON-NAME - a cellular-retinol-binding protein
COMMENT - Plasma retinol-binding protein (RBPs) and cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) are specific carriers of the alcohol form of vitamin A (retinol) in body fluids and within the cell, respectively.
/The sequestration of retinol inside a high-affinity binding-protein draws retinol into the cell and protects it from unfettered metabolism, while still allowing the formation of retinyl esters |CITS: [9932510][7683727]|. LRAT, the enzyme that forms retinyl-esters, can access retinol when it is bound to CRBP1 |CITS: [3198596][3178828]|.
/
/The CRBPs are monomeric proteins of approximately 15.5 kDa belonging to a superfamily of small cytoplasmic proteins that specifically interact with hydrophobic ligands. Two such proteins (|FRAME: ENSG00000114115-MONOMER "CRBP I"| and |FRAME: ENSG00000114113-MONOMER "CRBP II"|) with distinct tissue distributions and retinoid-binding properties have been recognized in mammals. 
/
/The human CRBP I is expressed at high levels in many tissues, including ovary, adrenal and pituitary glands, and testis |CITS: [3751963 ]|, while CRBP II is confined essentially to the small intestine. In addition, the Kd of the retinol-CRBP I complex is as low as 0.1 nM |CITS: [7744071]|, whereas the binding of retinol to CRBP II is ~100-fold weaker |CITS: [1995621]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Lignins
TYPES - Aromatic-Polymers
COMMON-NAME - a lignin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Lignins Lignin| is a complex phenolic biopolymer and an integral part of the secondary cell walls of plants and some algae. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, exceeded only by |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, and constitutes from a quarter to a third of the dry mass of wood.
/
/During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.
/
/Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
/The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strengtth.
/
/Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: RXN-17136 "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

COMMENT - G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large protein family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses, inside the cell.
/
/G proteincoupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, choanoflagellates,and animals. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change that allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated heterotrimeric G-protein (|FRAME: EC-3.6.5.1 "EC 3.6.5.1"|) by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G protein's &alpha; subunit, together with the bound GTP, dissociates from the &beta; and &gamma; subunits and interact with either intracellular signaling proteins or directly with functional proteins, depending on the &alpha; subunit type.

UNIQUE-ID - Gibberellins
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
TYPES - Diterpenes
COMMON-NAME - a gibberellin
COMMENT - Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, sex expression, enzyme induction, and leaf and fruit senescence.
/
/All known gibberellins are diterpenoid acids that are synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol until they reach their biologically-active form (see |FRAME: PWY-5052|). The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery.
/
/All gibberellins have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME: CPD1F-95| and |FRAME: CPD1F-134|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-95|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-134|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.  C<sub>20</sub>-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C<sub>19</sub>-GAs (note that not all C<sub>19</sub>-GAs are bioactive).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Strigolactones
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a strigolactone
COMMENT - Strigolactones are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.
/
/Study of mutants lacking strigolactones suggest that the hormones are also involved in the regulation of shoot branching, acting as branch-inhibiting hormones |CITS: [15268852][15342640]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Tetramethylammonium-corrinoid-proteins
TYPES - Corrinoid-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein
COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.

/
/Unlike similar systems for |FRAME:CoM| methylation by |FRAME:METOH| and different methylamines, the enzymatic complex that methylates |FRAME:CoM| with methylated thiols consists of only two types of peptides. The MtsA peptide catalyzes both methyltransferase activities, which are catalyzed in the other systems by two different methyltransferase, MT1 and MT2 |CITS: [11073950]|. 
/The second peptide, MtsB, is a corrinoid protein, similar to the one found in the other systems. Earler studies suggested that one corrinoid cofactor is bound per MtsA:MtsB pair, and six to seven such pairs coprise a 480 kDa complex |CITS: [8335638][8282704]|. However, later work suggested that MtsA forms dimers in solution |CITS: [11073950]|.

/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties.

UNIQUE-ID - Inositols
TYPES - Cyclitols
COMMON-NAME - an inositol
COMMENT - Inositol is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential
/compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal
/transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathway (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H2
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/This particular entry is used for unknown acceptors that transfer two electrons and two protons.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

COMMON-NAME - a ganglioside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Gangliosides "Gangliosides"| are molecules composed of |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids| (|FRAME: Ceramides| and |FRAME: Oligosaccharides|) with one or more sialic acids (usually |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE|) linked to the sugar chain. They are components of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appear to concentrate in lipid rafts.
/
/The name ganglioside is derived from the ganglion cells of the brain, from which the first gangliosides were isolated by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942 |CITS: [Klenk42]|. Indeed, gangliosides dominate the composition of the glycocalyces of most of the cells of the vertebrate nervous system. Although gangliosides with various glycan structures are found in every vertebrate tissue, they are markedly more abundant in the nervous system, where each cell has on average about 10 million cell surface gangliosides |CITS: [27261254]|.
/
/Variations in the sialoglycan and lipid components of the gangliosides result in hundreds of distinct ganglioside structures with a variety of functions that ranges from regulating receptor tyrosine kinases to directing cell-cell communication, cell-substrate interaction, adhesion, and protein targeting |CITS: [17991443]|. Mammalian brain gangliosides, however, are dominated by only four types of gangliosides - |FRAME: CPD-7188 "ganglioside GM1a|, |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINYL-ETCETERA-GLUCOSYLCERA "ganglioside GD1a"|, |FRAME: Ganglioside-GD1b "ganglioside GD1b"| and |FRAME: Ganglioside-GT1b "ganglioside GT1b"| |CITS: [22735313]|. The ceramide lipid components of brain gangliosides are dominated by a single fatty acid (|FRAME: STEARIC_ACID|) attached to one of two sphingoid bases, |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE| and |FRAME: CPD-19684| |CITS: [21113547]|.
/While many non-human mammals synthesize gangliosides that contain two types of sialic acids - |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE| and |FRAME: CPD-273|, mammalian brain gangliosides almost exclusively carry the former.
/
/Like other glycosphingolipids, gangliosides are biosynthesized stepwise by a series of glycosyltransferases that use nucleotide sugar donors to first glucosylate ceramide and then elongate the saccharide chain .|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.
/
/The ceramide lipid of glycosphingolipids is embedded in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, with the glycan extending  2-2.5 nm outward, perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer |CITS: [19056784]|. What makes gangliosides different from other glycosphingolipids is the incorporation of sialic acids. With a mean Pka value of around 2.6, sialic acids are more acidic than the majority of carboxylic acids and negatively charged at most physiological pH values.
/
/<b>About the nomenclature of gangliosides</b>
/
/Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.
/
/A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.
/The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).
/
/In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides a-series|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides b-series|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a b and c in their names.
/
/So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

TYPES - Glycosphingolipids
COMMON-NAME - a gala-series glycosphingolipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids Glycosphingolipids| are a family of complex lipids composed of |FRAME: Ceramides| and mono- or oligosaccharide moieties that play an important role in various cellular functions including recognition, cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation |CITS: [8490246]|. The lipid portion is embedded in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and the sugar chains extended to the outer environment, acting as an antigen.
/
/Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.
/
/Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.
/
/Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.
/
/|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide| is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.
/
/The core structure that defines the |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs "gala series"| is Gal&alpha;(1,4)Gal&beta;-Cer.

UNIQUE-ID - tRNAs
TYPES - All-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycosaminoglycans
TYPES - Glycans
COMMON-NAME - a glycosaminoglycan
COMMENT - Glycosaminoglycans (also known as mucopolysaccharides) are important components of connective tissues. They are composed of long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit. The repeating units consist of an <i>N</i>-acetyl-hexosamine and a hexose or hexuronic acid, either or both of which are often sulfated.
/Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid
/unit they contain (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-12521|, |FRAME: CPD-12515|, galactose, |FRAME:CPD-12557|, |FRAME: CPD-12541|). 
/
/Glycosaminoglycans are divided into four main classes:  |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| and |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate|; |FRAME: HEPARIN| and |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate|;  |FRAME: Hyaluronan|; and |FRAME: KERATAN-6-SULFATE|. With the exception of hyaluronan, the polysaccharide chains are linked covalently at the reducing end to a core protein through an <i>O</i>-glycosidic linkage to a serine residue, thus forming proteoglycans.

COMMENT - Iron-sulfur clusters are cofators of |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur proteins"| and consist of a cluster of two to four iron atoms linked to sulfides, some of which are cysteine residues of the protein.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in
/the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
/and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.

COMMON-NAME - an oxidized coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>
COMMENT - One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green
/fluorescence when irradiated with UV light. This fluorescence is due to F420, a cofactor
/that was identified on the basis of this feature.
/This compound, named for its intense absorbance at 420 nm, was originally isolated by Cheeseman et
/al |CITS: [5079072]|, and later identified by Eirich et al as the N-(N-L-lactyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-L-
/glutamic acid phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate |CITS: [728375]|.
/
/F420 biosynthetic pathway produces the intermediate F420-0, which contains no glutamate side chains.
/Glutamates are then added by several enzymes. F420 molecules isolated from different organisms
/differ in the number of the glutamate molecules in the side chains, as well as the nature of the bond
/(which could be either &alpha; or &gamma;) |CITS: [12909715][12867481][11717263]|.

/
/Heme <i>a</i> was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-1.9.3.1| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "Heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is similar to |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain. Both the formyl group and the isoprenoid side chain play important roles in conservation of the energy that is released by oxygen reduction by cytochrome c oxidase.
/
/Heme <i>a</i> is part of |FRAME: A-type-Cytochromes "<i>a</i>-type cytochromes"|. Like in |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|, heme <i>a</i> is often attached to the apoprotein through a coordinate bond between the heme iron and a conserved amino acid side-chain.

UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.
/
/Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

/
/EntB is a bifunctional protein that consists of an N-terminal isochorismatase domain and a C-terminal aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain |CITS: [9214294]|. The isochorismatase domain catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| from |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE| (|FRAME: EC-3.3.2.1|).
/
/The <i>apo</i>-ArCP domain first undergoes phosphopantetheinylation catalyzed by EntD, turning EntB into the active <i>holo</i>-EntB.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of less than 6 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 13-22 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 23 carbons or longer.
/ 
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-two-electrons-acceptors

COMMON-NAME - an reduced unknown two electrons acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

COMMENT - It has been shown that Cystein 78 of the DsrE protein of |FRAME: TAX-1049| is absolutely required for the interaction of the DsrEFH complex with DsrC.

//
UNIQUE-ID - DsrC-trisulfides
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC]-trisulfide
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. A second cyteine residue (CysB), located 11 residues before CysA, is also involved in DsrC's activity.
/
/In the sulfur-oxidizer |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB).
/
/During sulfite reduction, DsrAB adds the sulfur atom of sulfite to DsrC, forming a trisulfide bridge with the two cysteine residues. This third sulfur atom is then released in the form of hydrogen sulfide in a reaction catalyzed by DsrK, restoring DsrC to its reduced form |CITS: [26680199]|.

This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.

UNIQUE-ID - MttC-Proteins
TYPES - Trimethylamine-corrinoid-proteins
COMMON-NAME - a [Co(I) trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein]
COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.
/
/Reconstitution of |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|-dependent |FRAME:CoM| (CoM) methylation showed that three polypeptides were involved - |FRAME:CPLX-7100|, |FRAME:MONOMER-12207| and |FRAME:MONOMER-12205|.
/
/The first two proteins, of sizes 52 and 26 kDa, respectively, copurified as a single trimethylamine methyltransferase (TMA-MT). Gel permeation of the TMA-MT fraction demonstrated that the 52- kDa methyltransferase eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, suggesting a multimeric structure. The 26-kDa corrinoid protein eluted primarily as a monomer, although a small fraction of it eluted with the 280-kDa peak, indicating that the two proteins weakly associate |CITS: [9006042]|.

/
/Coenzyme M (CoM) is methylated during methanogenesis from monomethyamine in a reaction catalyzed by three proteins. Using monomethylamine, a 52-kDa polypeptide termed |FRAME:CPLX-7101| (MMAMT) methylates the corrinoid cofactor bound to a second polypeptide, |FRAME: MONOMER-12209| (MMCP). Methylated MMCP then serves as a substrate for |FRAME:MONOMER-12205| (MT2-A), which methylates CoM.

TYPES - Lipopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a lipid A
COMMENT - Lipid A is a lipid component of the |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides "lipopolysaccharides"| of Gram-negative bacteria. Its hydrophobic nature allows it to anchor the LPS to the outer membrane.
/
/Lipid A consists of two glucosamine units with four to six attached acyl chains, and normally one phosphate group on each of the glucosamines. Four &beta; hydroxy acyl chains, 10 to 16 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars. Two additional acyl chains are often attached to the beta hydroxy group of two of the four &beta; hydroxy acyl chains.
/
/The |FRAME: TAX-562| lipid A, whose structure is shown as an example, typically has four C14 hydroxy acyl chains attached to the sugars and one C14 and one C12 attached to the beta hydroxy groups.

/Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negatives, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.
/
/The core polysaccharide usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.

UNIQUE-ID - Phenolphthiocerol-B

COMMON-NAME - a phenol phthiocerol B
COMMENT - |FRAME: Phthiocerols Phthiocerol|-based lipids and glycolipids have been found in many species of |FRAME: TAX-1762|, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-33894|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1777|, |FRAME: TAX-1769| and |FRAME: TAX-1809| |CITS: [3149973]|.
/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached. Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10.
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/Many organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-1769|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, and |FRAME: TAX-78331|, produce the related compound |FRAME: Phenolphthiocerols phenolphthiocerol|, which contains a phenol group at the &omega; end of the molecule |CITS: [3113946]|.
/
/The phenol is usually glycosylated by a type or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-78331| the trisaccharide (2,3,4-tri-<i>O</i>-methyl L-fucopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-rhamnopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-2-<i>O</i>-methyl L-rhamnopyranose) is attached.
/
/In addition, the two secondary alcohol functions are often esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| or |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| (see |FRAME: CPD-18579|) |CITS: [3113946]|.

COMMENT - Aureolic acids are glycoside compounds that have a 1-keto-8,9-dihydroxyanthracene skeleton, a functionalized alkyl chain at the 3- position, a disaccharide and a trisaccharide unit.
/
/All aureolic acid-group drugs (including |FRAME: CPD-13955|, chromomycin A3, olivomycin A, UCH9, and |FRAME: CPD-14364|) contain the same tricyclic core moiety, but differ mainly with regard to their saccharide moieties, which consist of various 2,6-dideoxysugar chains that are linked at the 2- and 6-positions of the aglycon moiety. The structural variations in the glycosidic moieties are responsible for subtle differences in the DNA binding and activity profiles amongst the group members |CITS: [15712316]|.
/
/Studies have shown that aureolic acids from a dimer with a Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation at the center of the dimer before they bind to their DNA targets. The trisaccharide moiety is essential for dimer formation |CITS: [8329387][7666419][ 8422355][1731073]|, while the disaccharide interacts with the phosphate backbone of the DNA.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Jasmonic-Acids
TYPES - Jasmonates
COMMON-NAME - a jasmonic acid
COMMENT - Jasmonic acid is an important phytohormone. Four different stereoisomers of this compound exist, based on the
/bond orientation at positions 3 and 7 on the cyclopentone ring. This compound represents the general structure for all four
/forms.
/
/Only two of the stereoisomers occur naturally:
/|FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium
/within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers
/within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But,
/in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|.
/
/The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA
/metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Manumycins
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a manumycin
COMMENT - The manumycins are a unique group of epoxyquinone natural products. Since their discovery in 1963 |CITS: [14208615]|, more than 30 manumycin-related natural products have been reported |CITS: [9652122]|. They all share a common structural skeleton with a 2-amino-4-hydroxyl-5,6-epoxycyclohex-2-enone (mC7N) core. They differ in the nature of the acyl side chain on the amino nitrogen (known as the upper side chain) and the acyl side chain at the C4 position (the lower side chain).
/Even though there is variability in the composition of the lower chain, it is always terminated by a 2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (C5N) moiety.
/
/In addition to antibacterial, anticoccidial, and antifungal activities |CITS: [9652122]|, manumycin compounds display strong inhibitory activities against |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.58| |CITS: [8460134][17363690]|, |FRAME: EC-3.4.22.36| |CITS: [8982335]|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.10| |CITS: [16319058]|, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.7| |CITS: [17373546]|, and thus are drug candidates to treat cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and Alzheimer disease |CITS: [23890006]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Phenylurea-Cytokinins
TYPES - Cytokinins
COMMON-NAME - a phenylurea-type cytokinin
COMMENT - Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.

/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.

The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.
/
/Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the <i>N</i>-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.
/
/The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Dapdiamides
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a dapdiamide
COMMENT - This family of antibiotics, discovered in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-549|, consists of fumaramoyl and epoxysuccinamoyl dipeptides. It is named for the presence of |FRAME: 23-Diaminopropanoate| (DAP) and two amide linkages in the antibiotic scaffold |CITS: [20041689]|.
/
/The compounds are similar in structure to synthetic |FRAME: CPD0-1236| dipeptides, which show broad spectrum activity by targeting bacterial and fungal |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.16|, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the formation of the essential cell-wall building block |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| |CITS: [2111163][1901701]|.
/
/These compounds are likely cleaved intracellularly to generate acyl-DAP warheads that interact with the enzyme. The fumaramoyl-DAP warheads which would be derived from |FRAME: CPD-18311|, |FRAME: CPD-17539|, |FRAME: CPD-17540|, |FRAME: CPD-17541| and |FRAME: CPD-17542| provide a conjugated eneamide system that is likely attacked by the thiolate side chain of the active site Cys in the glutaminase domain of the enzyme, leading to alkylation of that residue, preventing the formation of ammonium essential of enzyme activity |CITS: [2111163]|. The epoxysuccinamoyl moiety in |FRAME: CPD-18309|, |FRAME: CPD-18310|, and |FRAME: CPD-17543| could function as a similar inactivating electrophile for the catalytic Cys residue |CITS: [19807062]|.

COMMON-NAME - an anthracycline
COMMENT - Anthracyclines are a class of antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1883| bacteria that are used in cancer as chemotherapy drugs. 
/
/This group of antibiotics is defined by the presence of a four fused-ring aromatic system, based on a 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-5,12-naphthacenequinone framework, which usually occurs as a glycoside with a deoxy(amino)sugar.
/The framework is synthesized by a polyketide-synthase from an acetyl-CoA or propanoyl-CoA starter unit and malonyl-CoA extender units, and subsequently modified by other enzymes |CITS: [11851469]|.
/
/The anthracyclines intercalate between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand, inhibit topoisomerase II enzymes, and prevent DNA replication. They are among the most effective anticancer treatments ever developed and are effective against more types of cancer than any other class of chemotherapeutic agents.

Piperidine alkaloids, for instance piperine are often found in plant families such as <i>Piperaceae</i> or coniine in the <i>Apiacea</i>. Pyridine alkaloids such as nicotine are again more widely distributed and often associated with other alkaloids of the pyrrolidine and piperidine type. Some members of this subclass are biological active, acting as inhibitors for sugar-hydrolyzing enzymes, others have been utilized because of their pharmaceutical potential in the treatment of the human disease AIDS.

UNIQUE-ID - PEPTIDE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Peptide Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Peptide alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from a varying number of peptide-bounded and subsequently cyclized amino acids. A discrete structural feature is the almost common occurrence of an aromatic styrylamide group formed from the amino acid phenylalanine. Peptide alkaloids such as zizyphine are mostly found in the plant family <i>Rhamnaceae</i> but are also present in a few other plant families and in fungi, for instance &alpha;-amanithin the toxic principle in the death cap mushroom (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>).
//
UNIQUE-ID - BETALAIN-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Betalaine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Betalain alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) via the intermediate betalamic acid representing the common chromphore of betalains. The water soluble betalain alkaloids split up into two major groups, the betacyanins and betaxanthins. Betacyanins, for instance amaranthin and betaxanthins such as indicaxanthin are often found in fruits, flowers and leaves of higher plants. Betalaines replace other biological important plant pigments such as anthocyanine in most of the plant families of the order <i>Centrospermae</i>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PYRROLIZIDINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The group of pyrolizidine contains some of the most poisonous plant alkaloids. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are biosynthetically derived from the amino acid ornithine via the amines putrescine and homospermidine. The skeleton of pyrrolizidine is composed of fused two 5-membered rings connected through a nitrogen bridge which are often esterified with amino alcohols (necines). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids such as senecionine occur mostly in the <i>Compositae</i> family especially in the genus <i>Senecio</i>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - POLYKETIDE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Polyketide Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - A smaller number of alkaloids that are derived from a polyketide pathway are combined under the subclass of polyketide alkaloids. Polyketide alkaloids, for instance pinidine are found in plant families such as the <i>Pinaceae</i> and &gamma;-coniceine in the <i>Apiacea</i> where alkaloids are known to be rather uncommon.
//
UNIQUE-ID - INDOLE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Indole Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The majority of indole alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid tryptophan and the monoterpenoid precursor secologanin. Condensation of these two classes produces a wide range of complex skeletons in this division. Indole alkaloids such as vindoline occur extensively in the plant families <i>Apocynacea</i>, borreline in the <i>Rubiacea</i> and strychnine in the <i>Loganiacea</i> but are also present in a smaller number and variety in other angiosperm families. Many indole alkaloids are useful drugs possessing clinical values such as the tranquillizer reserpine or the ergot alkaloids employed for their relaxing and migraine relieving properties.   
//
UNIQUE-ID - TROPANE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Tropane Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Tropane alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid ornithine. Some tropane alkaloids such as atropine and hyoscyamine also recruit parts of their structure (tropanic acid moiety) from phenylalanine. Tropane alkaloids such as tropine occur primarily in the plant families <i>Solanaceae</i> and cocaine in the family <i>Erythroxylaceae</i>. Many members of the tropane alkaloid group have been exploited for their useful medicinal properties but are also considered to be highly addictive.
//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Quinoline Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The biosynthetic origin of quinoline alkaloids is the aromatic amine anthranilic (2-aminobenzoic) acid involved in the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. The skeleton of quinoline alkaloids constitutes a bicyclic system with a fused benzene and pyridine ring. The attachment of a furan ring to the pyridine nucleus generates furoquinolines (e.g. furacridone), an important subgroup of quinoline alkaloids. The plant family <i>Rutaceae</i> represents the major source of quinoline alkaloids, e.g. maculine. Quinoline alkaloide are known to possess pharmaceutical activites but only a few such as quinine are used in medicine because of their antimalarial properties.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PURINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Purine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Purine alkaloids are biosynthetically derived from xanthosine. Purine alkaloids contain e.g. N-alkyl derivatives such as caffeine, theophylline and theobromine that have been widely used due to their pharmacological properties. Many of the purine alkaloids such as <i>trans</i>-zeatin being found in a number of plant families exhibit phytohormonal activity as cytokinins.

The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

UNIQUE-ID - PLASTOQUINONE
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinone
COMMENT - |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

The yellow or red colored compounds have some commercial relevance as natural dyes. 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones serve as laxatives.
/
/In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the successive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha;-keto-acyl chain, which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine.
/
/Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.

UNIQUE-ID - O-Antigens
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - an <i>O</i>-antigen
COMMENT - <i>O</i>-antigens are part of |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (lipid A), a core polysaccharide, and polysaccharide (<i>O</i>) side chains.
/
/The side chain is referred to as an <i>O</i>-antigen. The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.
/
/The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

TYPES - tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>leu</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>leu</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: LEU|.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|.

/The solution structure of tRNA(sec) has been chemically evaluated |CITS: [8510147]|.

COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>glx</SUP> is a class consisting of two |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNAs| - |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: GLN|, and |FRAME: GLT-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: GLT|. The need for such a class arises from the existence of enzymes that can accept both tRNAs (see |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.24|).
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|.

COMMENT - The Globo-H antigen was first isolated from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in 1983 |CITS: [ 6863318]|. Globo H is overexpressed on a variety of epithelial cell tumors such as colon, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancers. Patients with Globo H-positive tumors show a shorter survival in comparison to patients with Globo H-negative tumors |CITS: [2554552]|.
/
/Since globo H is not expressed in normal tissue except for weak expression in the apical epithelial cells at lumen borders, a site that is inaccessible to the immune system |CITS: [6711680][9334808]|, it is considered an ideal target for immunotherapy of many epithelial cancers. Two phase I trials of a Globo H-based vaccine in breast and prostate cancer, respectively, have shown promising results  |CITS: [10318949][11248068]|, and efforts to develop a globo H cancer vaccine are continues |CITS: [25665650]|.

/The |FRAME: FORSSMAN-HAPTEN "Forssman hapten"| (Fs), which was described in 1911 |CITS: [Forssman11]|, is one of the most potent haptenic sphingoglycolipids |CITS: [13239189][14241772][4538505][4199759][4459265]|.
/Primates, including humans, lack Fs synthase activity, and have naturally occurring Fs antibodies in plasma. However, some individuals with the enigmatic ABO subgroup A<sub>pae</sub> were shown to expressed Fs glycolipids on their erythrocites |CITS: [23255552]|. The compound was also reported from human tumors |CITS: [4634984]|.
/
/Primates and humans have a gene that encodes the Fs synthase, but it encodes an inactive protein |CITS: [10506200]|. In individuals that do express the Fs antigen, the |FRAME: HS07505| gene contains a mutation that results in an arginine to glutamine change at residue 296. Transfection experiments and molecular modeling showed that the Agr296Gln mutation reactivates the human Fs synthase. Based on these findings, the authors suggested to name a new histo-blood group system in man, FORS |CITS: [23255552]|.

COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>ala</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>ala</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

/<b>About the nomenclature of gangliosides</b>
/
/Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.
/
/A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.
/The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).
/
/In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides a-series|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides b-series|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a b and c in their names.
/
/So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>phe</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>phe</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: PHE|.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|.

COMMON-NAME - a medium chain fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of less than 6 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 13-22 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 23 carbons or longer.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

UNIQUE-ID - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an unsaturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC protein]-dithiol
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.
/
/In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.

COMMENT - This generic class describes either an |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| within a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. In the case of |FRAME: SER|, R = H, in the case of |FRAME: THR|, R = CH<sub>3</sub>.
/
/|FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzyme also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

TYPES - 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Reduced-ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.

The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit |CITS: [9363431][21091511]|.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.

UNIQUE-ID - Ibuprofen
TYPES - Monocarboxylates
COMMON-NAME - ibuprofen
COMMENT - Ibuprofen is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.
/Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.
/Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).
/
/Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.
/
/The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| <i>in vivo</i> to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Hemicelluloses
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - hemicellulose
COMMENT - Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.
/
/The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
/Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.
/
/Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.
/
/Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
/However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.
/D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: 1-4-Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.
/
/Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.
/
/Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

UNIQUE-ID - bacitracin
TYPES - Peptide-Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - bacitracin
COMMENT - Bacitracin is a mixture of at least nine closely related homodetic cyclic peptides produced by |FRAME: TAX-1423| and |FRAME: TAX-1402|, which is particularly active against Gram-positive bacteria.
/
/Bacitracin disrupts cell wall and peptidoglycan synthesis by binding as a complex with metallic ions to |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE|, thus preventing its dephosphorylation into |FRAME: CPD-9646| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.27|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-9646| is a lipid carrier that is essential for the synthesis of many cell wall polymers including peptidoglycan. By sequestrating |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE| and preventing its dephosphorylation back into |FRAME: CPD-9646|, bacitracin prevents the loading of peptidoglycan precursors on the lipid carrier. Because translocation of these precursors to the external side of the membrane is drastically or totally impaired, further biosynthesis of the constituents of the cell envelope is stopped, eventually resulting in cell death.

COMMENT - Furan-containing fatty acids are generated in large amounts in algae, but they are also produced by plants and microorganisms. Fish and other marine organisms as well as mammals consume these acids in their food and incorporate them into phospholipids and cholesterol esters. They are catabolized to dibasic urofuran acids, which are excreted in the urine.
/
/Furan-containing fatty acids react readily with peroxyl radicals to generate dioxoenes. Their radical-scavenging ability may contribute to the protective properties of fish and fish oil diets against mortality from heart disease |CITS: [Okada90][8996648][16296395]|.

/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of less than 6 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.

/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid.

COMMON-NAME - a neomycin
COMMENT - Neomycins are a family of broad-spectrum highly toxic antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1906|. They were discovered in 1949 by Waksman and Lechevalier (Waksman later received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine) |CITS: [17782716]|.
/
/Neomycin usually exists as a complex composed of two stereoisomers, |FRAME: CPD-14142| and |FRAME: CPD-14141|, which are the two active components. A third component, |FRAME: CPD-14137 "neomycin A"|, which is a degradation product, is present in small quantities.
/
/Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

The lividomycins were discovered In Japan in the early 70s |CITS: [5091208][5092785][5092786][ 4624613][4647833]|. Like other aminoglucoside antibiotics, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA |CITS: [4945812][4586150]|. 
/
/Despite promising initial results against urinary tract infections |CITS: [4579561][4579564][4203572]|, tuberculosis |CITS:[4721804][4142798]| and other respiratory tract infections |CITS: [807755][1041282]|, lividomycin never became widely used.

COMMON-NAME - a kanamycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Kanamycins Kanamycins| are a group of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1967|. The compounds were discovered in 1957 by researchers in the National Institute of Health of Tokyo, Japan |CITS: [13513509][13595489]|. Due to their wide range of activity, especially against severe staphylococcal and mycobacterial infections, these antibiotics gained almost immediate acceptance, and the most common form, |FRAME: CPD-4821|, was produced commercially within a year of its discovery |CITS: [13566481]|.
/
/Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|. Kanamycins are currently used to treat a wide variety of infections.
/
/Kanamycins share several biosynthetic intermediates with other aminoglycosides, including the core moiety |FRAME: CPD-10151| and the pseudodisaccharides |FRAME: CPD-14126|, |FRAME: CPD-14125| and |FRAME: CPD-14137|.
/
/While the main product produced by |FRAME: TAX-1967| is |FRAME: CPD-4821| (R1 = NH2; R2 = OH), additional products are also produced, including |FRAME: CPD-4822| (R1 = R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>), |FRAME: CPD-4823| (R1 = OH; R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>) |CITS: [13563334][13587408]|, |FRAME: CPD-14138| (similar to |FRAME: CPD-4821|, but contains a glucose moiety instead of the kinosamine moiety) |CITS: [Adams96]| and |FRAME: CPD-4824| (R1 = R2 = OH) |CITS: [Chang80]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Gentamycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a gentamicin
COMMENT - Gentamicins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by Gram-positive bacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-1873| genus. They were discovered in 1963 by a group of scientists at the Schering Corporation |CITS: [14274893]|.
/
/Gentamicins are particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, and are bactericidal. They act by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis. Despite their high antibacterial activity, intravenous use is limited by their ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, they are used commonly as a topical treatment to skin infections. The most common form of gentamycin is the C complex, which consists of a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-14213|, |FRAME: CPD-14216|, |FRAME: CPD-14211| and |FRAME: CPD-14212|. 
/
/While the name can be written as both gentamicin and gentamycin, the former is more common, to emphasize the biological origin of the antibiotics.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-14140 "Butirosins A"| and |FRAME: CPD-14193| are naturally occurring derivatives of the |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "2-aminoglycoside antibiotics"| |FRAME: CPD-14196| and |FRAME: CPD-14143|, respectively, produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1397| and discovered in the early 1970s |CITS: [4207954][4670491][4670492]|.
/
/The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
/
/Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Plant-Arabinogalactans
TYPES - Arabinogalactan
COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans are biopolymers consisting of arabinose and galactose residues. Two main classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "plant arabinogalactan"| and |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"|.
/
/|FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "Plant arabinogalactans"| (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.
/
/AG of type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. However, larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

UNIQUE-ID - Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans
TYPES - Arabinogalactan
COMMON-NAME - a mycobacterial arabinogalactan
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans are biopolymers consisting of arabinose and galactose residues. Two main classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "plant arabinogalactan"| and |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"|.
/
/The |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"| consists of arabinose and galactose monosaccharides in their furanose configurations and is a major structural component of the mycobacterial cell wall, where it is covalently attached to the peptidoglycan.
/
/The galactan portion of the polymer is linear, consisting of approximately 30 units with alternating &beta;-(1-5) and
/&beta;-(1-6) glycosidic linkages.
/
/|FRAME: Arabinans Arabinan| chains are attached at three branch points within the galactan chain (believed to be at residues 8, 10 and 12) |CITS: [16040600]|. These chains consist of about 30 residues |CITS: [18303028]|.
/
/The arabinan portion of the polymer is a complex branched structure with glycosidic linkages of &alpha;-(1-3),
/&beta;-(1-5), and &beta;-(1-2).
/
/In the Mycobacterial cell wall, the arabinan portion is usually capped with mycolic acids.

UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan-tetraose
TYPES - Xyloglucan-oligosaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan cellotetraose
COMMENT - Xyloglucan is the major hemicellulose in dicotyledon type I cell walls and has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked cellotetraose units, which are substituted in C-6 by a-D-xylosyl residues at two or three of the first three glucosyl residues (from the reducing end) |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by galactosyl, arabinosyl or fucosyls residues |CITS: [Fry93]|. The cross-linking between xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the three-dimensional matrix between adjacent cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/
/A common terminology refers to a glucosyl unit within a xylosylglycan as G and to a glucose residues substituted by D-xylose in a (1,6)-&alpha;-linkage as X.
/Using this terminology, most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide XXXG units.
/Subsequently (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues are added at the second and/or third xylose residue and an(1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose is added at the galactosyl unit of the third xylose residue |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|.

COMMENT - There is some ambiguity in the literature as to the identity of chitobiose regarding acetylation. Although |FRAME: CHITIN| consists of &beta;1&rarr;4 linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine residues, the name chitobiose was given to the parent non-acetylated disaccharide by analogy with |FRAME: CPD-15975 cellobiose|, the repeating disaccharide from |FRAME: CELLULOSE|. Thus the name chitobiose is used here for the disaccharide that contains glucosamine residues and not  the acetylated sugars.

COMMENT - Elongator tRNA<sup>met</sup> is a |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| used for extending a nascent peptide by an |FRAME: MET| residue. It differs from |FRAME: Initiation-tRNAmet|, which is involved in translation initiation.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

UNIQUE-ID - Lewis-Antigen
TYPES - Oligosaccharide-Protein-or-Lipid
COMMON-NAME - a Lewis epitope
COMMENT - The Lewis blood group antigens, discovered in 1946, are biosynthetically and structurally related carbohydrate structures used as markers of cell differentiation and embryonic development, based on fucosylation carried by a number of fucosyltransferases. The system is named after Mrs. H. D. G. Lewis, in whose serum the first member of the family was discovered |CITS: [20995492]|. However, the presence of the Lewis antigens is not limited to erytrocytes, and they are found in different tissues and organs.
/
/One of these fucosyltransferases, encoded by the |FRAME: HS10249| gene, is bifunctional and can fucosylate both the 3 and 4 positions of the penultimate sugar in the precursor disaccharide. The gene, also known as the Lewis gene, has a dominant allele (which was named Le) and a recessive non-functional allele (known as le). The &alpha;(1,4)-fucosyltransferase activity is only relevant when the substrates are derived from the |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharide"|, as that position is already occupied in the type 2 disaccharide.
/
/The first Lewis antigens to be discovered were the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope "Lewis a"| and |FRAME: Antigen-Leb "Lewis b"| antigens, which are produced from |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharides"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7832|). However, the &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| leads to formation of several related antigens known as the |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x epitope"| (also known as SSEA-1, for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1), |FRAME: Antigen-Ley "Lewis y epitope"|, and the |FRAME: sLea-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis x epitope"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7831|).

COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>gln</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>gln</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: GLN|. 
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in |FRAME: mRNAs mRNA| during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the phosphate group at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule, which binds the amino acid (in the form of an amino-acyl group).

COMMENT - |FRAME: Hyaluronan Hyaluronan| is an anionic, nonsulfated |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues, including the vitreous humor of the eye, the aorta, blood, brain, liver and skin |CITS: [354500]|. It is produced by almost all members of the animal kingdom as well as by certain members of streptococci |CITS: [9260563]|. Hyaluronan can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions. It forms a strikingly viscous solution and functions primarily as a joint lubricant and shock absorber, although it is also thought to be involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
/
/Hyaluronan is composed of repeating disaccharide unit of [|FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (&beta;1,4) |FRAME: CPD-12521|] (|FRAME: HYALURONATE|) linked by &beta; 1,3 linkages. 
/
/Though classified as a glycosaminoglycan, it differs from other members of this family. While all other glycosaminoglycans are synthesized by resident Golgi enzymes and covalently attached to core proteins, hyaluronan is synthesized at the inner face of the plasma membrane as a free linear polymer without any protein core. In addition, it is the only glycosaminoglycan that is not sulfated |CITS: [17408700]|.

COMMON-NAME - heparan sulfate
COMMENT - |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| (also known as heparitin sulfate)  is a member of the |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| family. It consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit composed of a hexuronic acid and a hexosamine.
/The most common repeating unit, which makes up around 50% of the total disaccharide units in heparan sulfate, is composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521| linked to |FRAME: CPD-12541|. In other units |FRAME: CPD-12521| may be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12515| or its sulfated form |FRAME: CPD-12518|, and |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| may be sulfated to |FRAME: CPD-12565|, or may be substituted by |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine| or |FRAME: CPD-12533|.
/
/Heparan sulfate binds to specific proteins such as antithrombin and several growth factors, thereby regulating various biological processes including anticoagulation and angiogenesis |CITS: [9151776]|. The unique sulfation pattern of a monosaccharide sequence within HS is believed to be critical for binding to the target protein.
/
/The structure of heparan sulfate is very similar to that of |FRAME: HEPARIN|. Heparan sulfate contains lower amounts of sulfate and less iduronic acid than heparin |CITS: [5484472]|. In addition, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains, while heparin disaccharides are sulfated randomly |CITS: [15047699]|. |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| chains comprise three different types of domains: S-domains that contain contiguous <i>N</i>-sulfated residues, unmodified <i>N</i>-acetyl-rich regions, and mixed transition zones between the S-domains and the unmodified segments. Only the S-domains have binding capacities for growth factors and other proteins |CITS: [11489926]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Heparan
TYPES - Glucosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - heparosan-[core protein]
COMMENT - This compound class describes a |FRAME: Heparosan| polymer, attached to a serine residue in a glycoprotein, prior to any subsequent modifications. In animal tissues heparosan is synthesized attached to cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins, known as "core proteins".
/
/Heparosan consists of a repeating disaccharide unit composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521|-(1,4)-|FRAME: CPD-12541|. The disaccharide units are linked by a (1-4) linkage to each other. The polymer chain is attached to the core proteins via a tetrasaccharide linkage region that differs in composition from the rest of the polymer.
/
/The heparosan skeleton serves as a starting point in the biosynthesis of several other glycosaminoglycan such as |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| and |FRAME: HEPARIN|, and bacterial heparosan is sometimes used for the synthesis of non-animal sourced heparin-like products.

UNIQUE-ID - HEPARIN
TYPES - Glucosaminoglycans

COMMENT - |FRAME: HEPARIN "Heparin"| is a glycosaminoglycan polymer with a molecular weight ranging from 3 to 30 kDa. It is composed of a variable sulfated repeating disaccharide units composed of hexuronic (either iduronic or glucuronic) acid and glucosamine residues, in which the 2 position of the hexuronic acid and the 2, 3, or 6 positions of glucosamine may be sulfated. The two residuces within a disaccharide are linked by a (1->4) bond, as are the disaccharides to each other.
/
/The main disaccharide unit consists of |FRAME: CPD-12518| and |FRAME: CPD-12533| [it is often referred to as IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S)]. However, |FRAME: CPD-12518| can be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12521|, and |FRAME: CPD-12533| can be replaced by |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine|, |FRAME: CPD-12545| or |FRAME: CPD-12565|.
/
/The basic IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharide accounts for at least 85% of heparin isolated from beef lung and about 75% of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa |CITS: [Casu89][Gatti79]|.
/
/Variations in the extent and location of sulfation, as well as the conformation of the alternating hexuronic acid residues, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity. By convention, heparin refers to molecules which possess a high sulfate content and large amounts of iduronic acid.
/
/The structure of |FRAME: HEPARIN| is very similar to that of |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| (also known as heparitin sulfate). Heparan sulfate contains lower amounts of sulfate and less iduronic acid than heparin |CITS: [5484472]|. In addition, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains, while heparin disaccharides are sulfated more uniformly |CITS: [15047699]|.

/
/Acharan sulfate has been shown to present several biological activities <i>in vitro</i>, including inhibition of angiogenesis due to inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and the decrease of mitogenic activity of fibroblast growth factor |CITS: [12510844][12650849][15081567]|.

COMMON-NAME - tRNA<SUP>asp</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>asp</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|. 
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

/Dermatan sulfate is expressed in many mammalian tissues and is the predominant glycan present in skin. Dermatan and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans have also been implicated in cardiovascular disease, tumorigenesis, infection, wound repair, and fibrosis |CITS: [12213784]|.

COMMON-NAME - a mycolate
COMMENT - Mycolic acids are the hallmark of the cell envelope of |FRAME: TAX-1773| and related species and genera. They comprise a homologous series of C60-C90 (2<i>R</i>)-alkyl-(3<i>R</i>)-hydroxy very long-chain fatty acids, and are found as either esters of |FRAME: Arabinogalactan| or as free lipids in the form of trehalose dimycolate (TDM). Both forms contribute to forming the two leaflets of the mycobacterial outer membrane, also called the mycomembrane, which protects the organism from antibiotics and the host's immune system  |CITS: [15653820][17555433][15353567]|.
/
/There is a significant variability in the structure of mycolic acids among different species. Acids from |FRAME: TAX-1716| species contain 22-38 carbon atoms, |FRAME: TAX-697025| and |FRAME: TAX-992401| spp. contain 30-36, |FRAME: TAX-37914| spp. contain 34-38, |FRAME: TAX-1827| spp. contain 34-52 in, |FRAME: TAX-1817| spp. contain 46-60, |FRAME: TAX-2053 <i>Gordonia</i>| spp. contain 46-66, |FRAME: TAX-2060| spp. contain 64-78 , |FRAME: TAX-1763| spp. contain 60-90, and |FRAME: TAX-286801| spp. contain up to 100 carbon atoms |CITS: [24374164]|.
/
/The acids are formed by a Claisen-type condensation of two components - the meromycolic chain and a fatty acid.
/The meromycolic chain of |FRAME: TAX-1773| typically incorporates a hydroxy group at C-1, a cyclopropyl ring fused onto the C-16/C-17 bond (at either a <i>cis</i> or a <i>trans</i> configuration), a methoxyl or oxo group at C-35, and a methyl group at C-36. The modifications and their positions may change among strains and species.
/
/Several structural classes of mycolic acids exist. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the most apolar ones, known as &alpha;-mycolic acids, contain 74-80 carbon atoms (out of which 22-26 carbons are located in the fatty acid moiety and the rest on the mero-chain) and generally two double bonds (that can be in either <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-configuration) or two <i>cis</i>-cyclopropyl groups located in the meromycolic chain. The cyclopropane rings are believed to protect the organism from oxidative stress |CITS: [15653820]|. &alpha;-Mycolic acids usually comprise more than 70 percent of the total mycolic acids in the cell.
/
/Other classes are defined by additional oxygen functions located in the distal part of the meromycolic chain, and include keto-, methoxy-, wax ester-, epoxy-, and hydroxy-types. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the oxygenated mycolic acids (keto-, methoxy-, and hydroxy-types) contain ~84-88 carbon atoms, and are thus four to six carbons longer than the &alpha;-mycolic acids from the same strains.
/
/The biosynthesis of mycolic acids is described in |FRAME: PWYG-321|.

UNIQUE-ID - Monounsaturated-fatty-acids
TYPES - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a monounsaturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Acetan Acetan| is an acidic heteropolysaccharide produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-28448| (previously known as <i>Acetobacter xylinum</i>) that consists of a cellulose backbone with side-chains attached to alternate glucose units. 
/
/The polymer is composed of repeating units of a heptasaccharide with the following structure: &alpha;-L-rhamnose-(1->6)-&beta;-D-glucose-(1->6)-&alpha;-D-glucose-(1->4)-&beta;-D-glucuronate-(1->2)-&alpha;-D-mannose-(1->3)-&beta;-D-glucose-(1->4)-&beta;-D-glucose. These repeating units are attached to each other via &beta;(1->4) links between the terminal two glucose units, forming a cellulose backbone with alternating pentasaccharide branches |CITS: [8370027][7780996]|.
/
/Acetan is structurally related to |FRAME: Xanthan|.

UNIQUE-ID - ALGINATE
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - alginate
COMMENT - |FRAME: ALGINATE Alginate| is a major component of the cell walls of |FRAME: TAX-2870| (brown algae), and can make up to 45% of the total algal material. It is a linear polysaccharide of (1-4)-linked |FRAME: CPD-15205|, with variable amounts of its C-5 epimer |FRAME: CPD-15204| |CITS: [Schmidt26]|. The |FRAME: CPD-15205| (M) and |FRAME: CPD-15204| (G) residues are arranged in homopolymeric regions of M and G blocks, interspaced with regions of alternating structure (MG blocks). The physicochemical properties of alginate depend on both the overall M to G ratio and the relative proportions of the three block types in the chain. G block-rich alginate forms a high-strength gel in presence of divalent cations such as calcium, and is found in more rigid parts of the alga. Alginates rich in M or MG blocks are more flexible. The composition varies among species, and within an organism according to the nature and the age of the tissues as well as to the season and to the growing area. Depending on its composition, alginate can absorb 200300 times its own weight in water, forming a viscous gum.
/
/Historically, alginate extracted from seaweed has had a wide variety of uses. Its unique physical properties enable it to be used as a stabilizer, viscosifier, and gelling agent in the food and beverage, paper and printing, biomaterials,
/and pharmaceutical industries |CITS:[9283015][9393029][11018131][12149954][16183570][20581859][25300542]|. Commercial varieties of alginate are extracted from several species, including the giant kelp |FRAME: TAX-35122|, |FRAME: TAX-52969|, and various types of |FRAME: TAX-33637|.
/
/The alginates formed by brown algae are non-acetylated. An acetylated form of alginate is produced by bacteria that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-286| and |FRAME: TAX-352| genera. The higher the degree of O-acetylation, the higher the viscosity and pseudoplastic rheology of the alginate |CITS: [Skjak-Braek88]|. The biological function of alginates differs between the two genera. In |FRAME: TAX-286| alginate is associated with biofilms, promoting bacterial adherence to target cell walls |CITS: [3155514]|. Alginate production is a major contributing factor in chronic pulmonary infections by |FRAME: TAX-287|, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis |CITS: [3155514]|. Most strains of |FRAME: TAX-287| do not produce alginate, although alginate is always produced in the lung of CF pateints. it is believed that alginate encapsulation protects the infecting bacterial cells from phagocytosis, as well as from antibiotic therapy. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-352| alginate is a structural element in the wall of the cyst, a desiccation-resistant capsule that is formed under adverse environmental conditions |CITS: [16912921]|.

COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome <i>c552</i>
COMMENT - The cytochrome <i>c552</i> family includes periplasmic cytochromes that function in nitrite reduction in Gram-negative bacteria such as enteric bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio.
/The enzyme, which is encoded by the nrfA gene, covalently binds five |FRAME: HEME_C| groups and one |FRAME: CA+2| ion per monomer |CITS: [9593308]|.
/
/It is believed that the cytochrome <i>c</i> encoded by the nrfB gene is responsible for the direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome <i>c552</i>.  The reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i> can then directly reduce nitrite to ammonia.
/Formate, pyruvate, ethanol, and D-lactate can serve as electron donors |CITS: [5338848][6381645][8409924] [7934939] [8057835][8039676]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c552</i> from |FRAME: TAX-915| is a misnamed 9.1-kDa monoheme protein and does not belong to this family. It belongs to the cytochrome <i>c551</i> |CITS: [9746537]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-C554
TYPES - Class-ID-Cytochromes-C
COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome <i>c554</i>
COMMENT - The tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17537| from |FRAME: TAX-915| contains one high-spin and three low-spin c-type hemes. The main role of the protein is to accept pairs of electrons from |FRAME: CPLX-1321| (HAO) and transfer them to a cytochrome acceptor, the tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17538| |CITS: [4372235]|.
/
/In addition, it has been shown that the protein also has significant nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. Ferrous cytochrome <i>c</i>554 reduced NO at a rate greater than 16 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable to rates of other known NO reductases |CITS: [16569009]|.
/
/The cycA gene that encodes the enzyme was identified by reverse translation of amino acid sequence obtained from peptides produced by proteolysis of the N-terminal region of the protein |CITS: [8195067]|. The sequencing of the complete genome revealed that three copies of the gene are present in the organism, named |FRAME: G-15261|, |FRAME: G-15266| and |FRAME: G-15267| |CITS: [12700255]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Starch
TYPES - Glucans
COMMON-NAME - starch
COMMENT - Starch combines two polymeric carbohydrates (polysaccharides) called |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-amylose"| and |FRAME: CPD-7043|. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| contains up to several thousand &alpha;-glucosyl units linked almost exclusively in linear &alpha;(1->4) linkages, with very few branches of &alpha;(1->6) linkages. In |FRAME: CPD-7043|, on the other hand, branching is common, and occurs approximately every 24-30 glucose monomer units. Amylopectin is one of, if not the largest, biological polymer known and contains from 10<sup>5</sup>10<sup>6</sup> glucose residues |CITS: [9730163]|. Unlike glycogen, the starch branches are concentrated in sections of the amylopectin molecule leading to clusters of chains that allow for indefinite growth of the polysaccharide.
/|FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| accounts for 30% of starch, while |FRAME: CPD-7043| accounts for the other 70%.
/
/The dense packing of branches at the root of the clusters generates tightly packed glucan chains that are close enough to align and form parallel double helical structures. The helices within a single cluster and neighbouring clusters align and form sections of crystalline structures separated by sections of amorphous material (containing the branches) thereby generating the semi-crystalline nature of amylopectin and of the ensuing starch granule. The crystallized chains become insoluble and typically collapse into a macrogranular solid that is osmotically inert |CITS: [9730163]|.
/
/The enzymes of starch synthesis and mobilization are unable to interact directly with the solid structure, with the exception of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.242 "granule-bound starch synthase"| |CITS: [14502990]|.
/
/The solid semi-crystalline starch and hydrosoluble |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| define two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide. Glycogen is by far the most widespread form of storage, as it is found in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. The appearance of semi-crystalline storage polysaccharides appears linked to the requirement of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fuel nitrogenase and protect it from oxygen through respiration of large amounts of stored carbon |CITS: [21220783]|.

COMMENT - <i>O</i>-Linked glycans are polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that are linked to a protein via the oxygen atom in the side chain of a |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| residue.
/Most commonly <i>O</i>-glycosylation begins with the attachment of |FRAME: CPD-3604| to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known. In eukaryotes, <i>O</i>-linked glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus one sugar at a time, while attached to the core protein.
/
/Mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked |FRAME: CPD-3604|, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals.

UNIQUE-ID - LysW-C-Terminal-L-Glutamate
TYPES - Protein-alpha-L-Glutamates
COMMON-NAME - a [LysW protein]-L-glutamate
COMMENT - LysW is an &alpha;-aminoadipate carrier protein used by many archaebacterial species for the synthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: LYS|. 
/
/The amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, an intermediate in the archaeal L-lysine biosynthetic pathway (which is also found in the hyperthermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-274|), is covalently linked to the &gamma;-carboxyl group of the last C-terminal residue of LysW (Glu54 in |FRAME: TAX-274|) by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5207| gene. LysW not only protects the amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, but also serves as a carrier protein, which is easily recognized by lysine biosynthesis enzymes. In this way all subsequent transformations leading to L-lyine occur when the amino acid is attached to LysW, and the |FRAME: CPD-468| side chain is converted to a C-terminal lysyl side chain in the LysW-conjugated form. Eventually, a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5222| gene releases the mature amino acid |CITS: [19620981]|.
/
/It has been shown that at least in |FRAME: TAX-2284| LysW is also used as a carrier protein for |FRAME: GLT| during the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ARG| |CITS: [23434852]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledon plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50,000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/A common form of xyloglucan that is often used in enzyme assays is produced from tamarind (|FRAME: TAX-58860|) seeds.

COMMENT - The histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharides are found at the terminal end of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins or sphingolipids, and serve as the actual substrates for various glycosyltransferases that terminate the chain elongation process, forming the ABH or Lewis antigens.
/
/Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.
/Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.
/
/Since ABH antigens are present not only on erythrocytes, but also on various organs such as the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [3965299][6172274]|, they are called histo-blood group ABH antigens.
/
/Six types of precursor disaccharides have been described:

UNIQUE-ID - Xylans
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - xylan
COMMENT - Xylan is a general name given for polysaccharides composed of xylose residues. It is the principal type of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in plant biomass representing the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after |FRAME: CELLULOSE| |CITS: [20113432]|.
/
/The most common form of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan|, which is found in the cell walls of plants and some algae. 
/Pure |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan "(1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is uncommon. In most cases it is decorated with additional sugars, in the form of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylan| or |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylan|.
/
/The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source. Arabinose and glucuronic acid are linked to the backbone by glycosidic bonds. Other substituents form ester bonds: acetate groups are bound directly to the backbone, while cinnamoyl (feruloyl and coumaroyl) residues are linked to the side chain arabinoses |CITS: [JOSELEAU]|.
/
/Due to its heterogeneous structure, the biodegradation of xylan requires the concerted action of a complex set of enzymes |CITS: [17008082]|. These enzymes are mainly extracellular and are secreted by numerous fungi and bacteria |CITS: [BIELY]|. The endoxylanases and &beta; xylosidases hydrolyze the main chain; the former generating short chain oligosaccharides and the latter acting on these products to liberate xylose. The side chains are hydrolyzed by glycanases, &alpha;-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases and feruloyl esterases |CITS: [11729262]|.
/
/|FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "(1->3)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is found only in cell walls of some red and green algae.

/
/It is usually associated with pectic substrates, and pectins with attached arabinans can be isolated from many fruits and vegetables such as apples, sugar beet, apricots, carrots, cabbage, onion and pears.

COMMON-NAME - a penicillin
COMMENT - Penicillins are medically important |FRAME: Beta-Lactams "&beta;-lactam"| antibiotics biosynthesized as end products by certain filamentous fungi, including |FRAME: TAX-5076| and |FRAME: TAX-162425|.
/
/&Beta;-Lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by the irreversible binding of their four-membered &beta;-lactam ring to the so-called |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins "penicillin binding proteins"| (PBPs).
/The PBPs are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since the &beta;-lactam moiety of |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive.
/Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.
/This irrevesible binding prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the formation of these cross-links, resulting in a defective cell wall and cell death.
/
/Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as syphilis, and infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, although more and more types of bacteria have acquired resistance.

UNIQUE-ID - L-methionyl-tRNAfmet
TYPES - Charged-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an L-methionyl-[initiator tRNA<SUP>met</SUP>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-methionyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group |CITS: [1103137]|.

When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. |FRAME: Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)"| are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. This class includes many important compounds, such as essential fatty acids and those that give drying oils their characteristic property.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - Teichoic-Acids
TYPES - Polysaccharide-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - a teichoic acid
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

COMMENT - The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmpspheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria. This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.

This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan has been described as a fisherman's net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.

TYPES - Plant-Arabinogalactans
COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan type II
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. However, larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - sLex-Antigen
TYPES - Lewis-Antigen
COMMON-NAME - a sialyl-Lewis x epitope
COMMENT - The sialyl Lewis-X (SLeX) antigen is expressed on glycolipids and glycoproteins on the cell surfaces. 
/
/In adults, SLeX antigen is expressed principally on the surfaces of granulocytic cells. It plays an important role during early steps of inflammatory response as a ligand of the three known selectins - E-selectin (also known as endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules, ELAM-1), P-Selectin, and L-selectin, resulting in the capture of leucocytes from the plasma and their attachment to blood endothelial cells |CITS: [2210723][7591266]|. In the case of L-selectin, the antigen needs to be sulfated first, forming |FRAME: 6-Sulfo-sLex-Antigen| |CITS: [9556613]|.
/
/The antigen is expressed in high frequency in tumor tissue where it plays a role in adhesion between tumor cells and blood endothelial cells during tumor metastases |CITS: [6386148][12029441][1699667][1701275]|.
/
/The SLeX antigen is synthesized from |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| by the action of two enzymes, |FRAME: EC-2.4.99.6| and |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.152| |CITS: [1339443][25498912]|.

UNIQUE-ID - sLea-Antigen
TYPES - Lewis-Antigen
COMMON-NAME - a sialyl-Lewis a epitope
COMMENT - The |FRAME: sLea-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis a epitope"| (SLe<sup>a</sup>) was discovered in 1979 with the use of a monoclonal antibody |CITS: [94699]|. While the antigen is believed to play an important role during embryogenesis |CITS: [6381330]|, in adults only low amounts of the antigen are present on normal epithelial cells |CITS: [6751528][6381289]|.
/When the selectin family of adhesion molecules was described, it was found that SLe<sup>a</sup>, along with the |FRAME: sLex-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis x antigen"|, is a ligand for E-selectin.
/
/Higher expression of the SLe<sup>a</sup> antigen in adults is strongly associated with cancer. It was found in high amounts on the surface of human pancreatic, colon and gastric cancer cell lines |CITS: [7142214][6188455]| and in human adenocarcinomas of the colon, stomach, pancreas and gall-bladder |CITS: [94699][6751528][2910493]|.
/
/The expression of the antigen has been linked to tumor progression. A gradual increase in SLe<sup>a</sup> was found in colon and rectum during neoplastic transformation and progression |CITS: [2863413]|, and its presence was restricted to tumorigenic and invasive human urothelial cell lines |CITS: [8900435]|. The antigen is responsible for adhesion of colon,
/pancreas, urinary bladder and gastric cancer cells to endothelium via its interaction with selectin E |CITS: [1716885][7687590][7678075][8900435][9578490]|.
/
/The expression level of the SLe<sup>a</sup> antigen is used as a prognostic factor for colorectal carcinoma, and is associated with high incidence of recurrence and the length of survival time |CITS: [8273774][7697593][9303355]|.

COMMENT - This class contains glycosides composed of one or two rhamnose moieties joined in an <i>O</i>-glycosidic linkage to a non-glycero lipid moiety.  The rhamnose moieties are linked to each other through an &alpha;-1,2-glycosidic linkage.  The lipid moiety is mainly two (sometimes one or three) &beta;-hydroxy fatty acid chains (represented here in part by R1 and R2) linked to each other through an ester bond between the &beta;-hydroxyl group of the chain distal to the glycosidic bond with the carboxyl group of the chain proximal to the glycosidic bond.  The carboxyl group of the distal chain is usually free, but in a few cases it is esterified with a short alkyl group.
/
/The fatty acid chains may be saturated, mono-unsaturated, or poly-unsaturated and the chain length may vary from C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub>.  In rare cases the rhamnose 2-hydroxyl group distal to the glycosidic bond may be acylated with a long chain alkenoate |CITS: [16160828] [20336292]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-aspartyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and mammals.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycogens
TYPES - Alpha-D-Glucans
COMMON-NAME - a glycogen
COMMENT - Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer that serves as a form of energy storage in animals and fungi. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch".
/
/Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 710% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.
/
/Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).
/Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal value for the particle size above which further growth is impossible as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. This generates a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter including 55 000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.
/
/Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Partially-Acetylated-Chitosans
TYPES - Chitosan
COMMON-NAME - a partially acetylated chitosan
COMMENT - Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &beta;-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
/Chitosan is found in the cell walls of some phytopathogenic fungi. The natural occuring chitosan has a degree of acetylation between 20-30%, with the acetyl residues grouped into clusters.
/
/Chitosan is mostly produced commercially by deacetylation of |FRAME: CHITIN| , which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans.
/The most popular technique for obtaining chitosan is alkaline deacetylation of chitin: this involves boiling chitin in concentrated alkali (50% w/v) for several hours. This process also yields chitosan with a degree of acetylation between 20-30%. However, in such a chitosan, unlike the naturally occurring chitosan, the acetyl groups are uniformly distributed along the polymer chain.
/
/Completely de-acetylated forms of chitosan do not exist naturally, but can be synthesized by special chemical treatment.

UNIQUE-ID - Porphyrans
TYPES - Red-Alage-Galactans
COMMON-NAME - a porphyran
COMMENT - Porphyran is a sulfated carbohydrate extracted from the cell wall of red seaweeds belonging to the genus |FRAME: TAX-2784| |CITS: [Anderson65]|. Unlike |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| and |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenan|, porphyran is not utilized as ingredient for its gelling or texturizing properties. However, it is one of the most consumed algal polysaccharides because it is the main component of edible |FRAME: TAX-2788| and |FRAME: TAX-2785|, both of which are extensively used in the preparation of sushi |CITS: [Correc11]|.
/
/The backbone of porphyran is composed of about 30% of |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| repeating units (1,3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose followed by 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-&alpha;-L-galactopyranose), with the remaining residues being 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate. The 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate residues can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-13430| by the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.5-RXN "galactose-6-sulfurylase, EC 2.5.1.5"|.
/
/In addition, the galactan backboned is decorated by methyl-ether groups at the C6 position of the 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose residues.
/
/As other sulfated galactans, porphyran may have some potential pharmacological applications |CITS: [18796647]|, based on, for example, its hypolipidemic |CITS: [19202270]| and anti-allergic properties |CITS: [16244430]|.

/|FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| consist of a backbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues, and are often branched. Unlike GMs, GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues.
/Glucomannans show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Low-molecular-weight GMs, acetylated at position 2 or 3 of some mannopyranose residues, were isolated from aspen and birch wood |CITS: [12668108]|. 
/Soluble, often partially acetylated GMs occur as constituents of bulbs, tubers, seeds, roots, and leaves of some non-gramineousmonocotyl plants.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Galactomannans
TYPES - 1-4-Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactomannan
COMMENT - Mannans are polymers composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked |FRAME: MANNOSE| residues. Pure mannans are rarely found, and most contain &alpha;(1,6)-linked galactopyranosyl side chains.
/
/The extent of galactosylation varies greatly, and the mannose : galactose ratio is one of the main characteristics of the polymer as it determines their physicochemical properties, such as solubility in water, density, and the viscosity of the solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. On one hand, slightly galactosylated linear mannans (about 4% galactose), have been isolated from the seed endosperm of vegetable ivory nut (|FRAME: TAX-115507|) and date (|FRAME: TAX-42345|). They are water-insoluble, resemble cellulose in conformation of the individual molecular chains, and occur in cellulose microfibrils of the plant tissues |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/On the other hand, heavily galactosylated polymers (up to 96%) are abundant in the cell walls of storage tissues (endosperm, cotyledons, perisperm) of many seeds. Those from the endosperm of some leguminous seeds, such as guar (|FRAME: TAX-3832|), locust bean or carob (|FRAME: TAX-20340|), and tara gum (|FRAME: TAX-191904|), are widely used commercially |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/Another important feature is the distribution of the galactopyranose residues along the mannan backbone, which affects the molecular interactions of the chains among themselves (self-association) and with other polysaccharides (cooperative associations) in solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

Both polymers consist of a bakbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues. GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues and are often branched.
/Both polymers show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/The mannan backbone of GGM from spruce wood consists of galactose, glucose, and mannose in the mole ratio 1 : 8 : 33, and contains segments of more than four mannopyranose residues, interrupted with a segment composed of both mannopyranose and glucopyranose, or two glucopyranose residues. Branches terminated by single galactose residues are attached at positions 2, 3, and 6 of mannose residues and at positions 3 and 6 of glucose residues of the backbone. Many of the mannose residues are acetylated at positions 2 and 3  |CITS: [11128591]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NARINGENIN-CMPD| is a flavanone that is abundant in citrus fruit, where it mainly occurs as glycosides such as |FRAME: NARINGENIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE| (naringenin-7-glucoside), |FRAME: NARINGIN| (the predominant flavanone in grapefruit), or |FRAME: CPD-7059|. It is also present in tomato.
/
/The naringenin and its glycosides content undergoes significant changes upon phytopathogen attack, and thus it appears that these compounds participate in the defense mechanism of |FRAME:TAX-2706| species and may act as fungicides |CITS: [15053528]|.
/
/|FRAME: NARINGIN Naringin| has been investigated with respect to its ability to scavenge oxygen free radicals involved in the oxidation of hemoglobin |CITS: [12967034]|, lowering the plasma total cholesterol level |CITS: [14738906]| and blocking the cytotoxity and apoptosis of |FRAME: CPD-15099| (Ara-C), a chemotherapeutical drug used for acute leukemia |CITS: [15135655]|.
/
/The bitterness of certain citrus species such as grapefruit (|FRAME:TAX-37656|), bitter orange (|FRAME:TAX-43166|) and pummelo (|FRAME:TAX-37334|) is caused by flavanone neohesperidosides such as naringin, in which a rhamnose is attached via the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose. Flavanone rutinosides such as |FRAME: CPD-7059|, in which the L-rhamnose attached to the C-6 hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety, are tasteless and occur predominantly in sweet citrus fruits such as orange (|FRAME:TAX-2711|) and mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>) |CITS: [15361143]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-14042| is not found in nature, and is only formed by chemical synthesis.

COMMON-NAME - a (1->3)-&beta;-D-xylan
COMMENT - |FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "&beta;-1,3-D-xylan"| is a polysaccharide composed of &beta;-1,3-linked |FRAME: BETA-D-XYLOSE| residues. This polysaccharide was first found in the siphonous green seaweed |FRAME: TAX-148944| as a water-insoluble and alkaline-soluble component of cell walls |CITS: [Mackie59]|. It was subsequently found in cell walls of some red (|FRAME: TAX-2784| and |FRAME: TAX-31346|) and green (|FRAME: TAX-76312|, |FRAME: TAX-3128| and |FRAME: TAX-170436|) algae |CITS: [13852998][Fukushi86][Yamagaki96][12860427]|. It has not been detected in cell walls of land plants, which contain |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan| instead.
/
/Analysis of |FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "&beta;-1,3-D-xylan"| from the siphonous green alga |FRAME: TAX-177073| showed that it is a linear heteropolysaccharide also containing glucose residues linked by &beta;(1,3) linkages as well as some xylose residues linked by &beta;(1,4) linkages.

COMMENT - The histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharides are found at the terminal end of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins or sphingolipids, and serve as the actual substrates for various glycosyltransferases that terminate the chain elongation process, forming the ABH or Lewis antigens.
/
/Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.
/Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.
/
/Since ABH antigens are present not only on erythrocytes, but also on various organs such as the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [3965299][6172274]|, they are called histo-blood group ABH antigens.

UNIQUE-ID - beta-Gal-13-alpha-GalNac-R
TYPES - Blood-Group-Antigen-Precursor
COMMON-NAME - a type 3 histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharide
COMMENT - The histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharides are found at the terminal end of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins or sphingolipids, and serve as the actual substrates for various glycosyltransferases that terminate the chain elongation process, forming the ABH or Lewis antigens.
/
/Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.
/Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.
/
/Since ABH antigens are present not only on erythrocytes, but also on various organs such as the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [3965299][6172274]|, they are called histo-blood group ABH antigens.
/
/Note the the type 3 histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharide corresponds to the |FRAME: Core1 "O-glycan core 1 "| structure.
/
/Six types of precursor disaccharides have been described:

UNIQUE-ID - Teichoic-Acid
TYPES - Teichoic-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a polyisoprenyl-teichoic acid
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Lipoteichoic-Acids
TYPES - Teichoic-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a lipoteichoic acid
COMMENT - The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.
/
/LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 13 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.
/
/LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

COMMON-NAME - a mono-rhamnolipid
COMMENT - This class contains glycosides composed of a single rhamnose moiety joined in an <i>O</i>-glycosidic linkage to a non-glycero lipid moiety.  The lipid moiety is mainly two (sometimes one or three) &beta;-hydroxy fatty acid chains (represented here in part by R1 and R2) linked to each other through an ester bond between the &beta;-hydroxyl group of the chain distal to the glycosidic bond with the carboxyl group of the chain proximal to the glycosidic bond.  The carboxyl group of the distal chain is usually free, but in a few cases it is esterified with a short alkyl group.  The fatty acid chains may be saturated, mono-unsaturated, or poly-unsaturated and the chain length may vary from C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub>.  In rare cases the rhamnose 2-hydroxyl group distal to the glycosidic bond may be acylated with a long chain alkenoate. |CITS: [16160828] [20336292]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Type-6-H-Antigen
TYPES - H-antigen
COMMON-NAME - an H type 6 histo-blood group antigen
COMMENT - The |FRAME: H-antigen "H antigens"| are fucosylated oligosaccharides that decorate proteins on the surface of red blood cells in people with O blood type. In people with A or B blood types an additional monosaccharide is attached to one of the &beta;-D-galactosyl residues of the H antigen (|FRAME: CPD-12557| in |FRAME: A-antigen "A antigens"| and |FRAME: GALACTOSE| in |FRAME: B-antigen "B antigens"|).
/
/These fucosylated structures are found not only on blood cells but also on many other cell types (mainly epithehal), and it has been suggested that they should be called histo-blood group antigens.
/
/The majority of the A, B and H antigens are linked to the ends of long polylactosamine chains attached mainly to band 3 protein (encoded by SLC4A1), the anion exchange protein of the red blood cells. A minor fraction of the antigens is attached to a ceramide moiety, forming neutral glycosphingolipids.
/
/Several H antigens exist, differing in their core disaccharide |CITS: [2093726]|. The different types are:

COMMENT - Cell walls of higher plants contain callose, which is a linear homopolysaccharide made up |FRAME: 1-3-beta-D-Glucans| with &beta;-1,6 branches. Callose plays an important role in many processes associated with plant development and in response to environmental stimuli in the form of abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose is also a transitory component of cell plate involved in the formation of new walls during cell division. It is a structural component of plasmodesmatal canals, and is also found in developing cell walls of fibre cells and cotton seed hairs |CITS: [19410266]|.
/
/The main enzyme in callose biosynthesis is callose synthase. The molecular mechanism underlying callose biosynthesis is still poorly understood. Molecular studies have revealed a set of genes in Arabidopsis genome that catalyze and degrade callose |CITS: [19286936]|. 12 glucan synthase like (GSL) genes appear to be involved in male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis |CITS: [18315544]|. Two genes, GSL1 and GSL5, are also known to play a role in pollen development and fertility |CITS: [16021399]|.

/Most of the glucuronoxylans have single 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl uronate residues (MeGlcA) attached at position 2. This structural type is usually named as 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-D-glucurono-D-xylan (MGX).

/However, GAX-type polymers consist of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan| backbone that contains about ten times more &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose side chains than glucuronate ones, while AGX-type polymers are |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| with a small proportion of the xylopyranose residues of the backbone disubstituted by two &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residuese |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Another difference is that GAX contain some xylopyranose units that are doubly substituted by both 4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. Unlike glucuronoxylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans are not acetylated |CITS: [15944805]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Arabinoxylan
TYPES - 1-4-beta-Xylan
COMMON-NAME - an arabinoxylan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Arabinoxylan Arabinoxylan| molecules contain a chain of &beta;-1,4-linked xylose units, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2,2 or 2,3-linked arabinofuranose residues. The ratio of arabinose to xylose residues varies from 0.2 to 0.9 depending on the plant and tissue.
/The arabinofuranose residues are often decorated further by acetyl, feruloyl and glucuronyl groups. The ferulate residues can form cross links between adjacent arabinoxylan molecules, forming |FRAME: Feraxan|.
/
/|FRAME: Arabinoxylan Arabinoxylans| are found in both the primary and secondary cell walls of plants, including woods and cereal grains, and are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, the second most abundant renewable polysaccharide after cellulose. Arabinoxylan polymers are the major hemicellulose component of cell walls of the starchy endosperm (flour) and outer layers (bran) of the cereal grain, and have been identified in a variety of the main commercial cereals including wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, corn and sorghum. They are also common in other plants such as rye grass, bamboo shoots, and pangola grass |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Arabinoglucuronoxylans
TYPES - 1-4-beta-Xylan
COMMON-NAME - an arabinoglucuronoxylan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans| (GAX) and |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylans| (AGX) are components of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| that have a similar structure - a &beta;(1&rarr;4)-D-xylopyranose backbone with single 4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residues attached at position 2 and 3, respectively.
/However, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans| consist of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan| backbone that contains about ten times more &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose side chains than glucuronate ones, while |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylans| are |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| with a small proportion of the xylopyranose residues of the backbone disubstituted by two &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residues.
/
/Another difference is that |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans| contain some xylopyranose units that are doubly substituted by both 4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Some of the arabinofuranose side chains in AGX are further substitued by either a &beta;-D-xylopyranose attached by a (1&rarr;2) linkage. This sugar moiety has been found usually esterified by ferulate at position 5 of the arabinofuranose unit and occur as a widespread component of grass cell walls |CITS: [Ishii97]|.
/
/The AGX type polymers occur in appreciable quantity in coniferous species, although it is usually not the dominant hemicellulosic component (an exception is the hemicellulose of the tropic conifer |FRAME: TAX-1030197| |CITS: [Bochicchio03]|). They are also the dominant hemicelluloses in the cell walls of lignified supporting tissues of grasses and cereals.

COMMON-NAME - polyisoprenyl-wall teichoic acid (<i>B. subtilis</i> W23)
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly(glycerol phosphate), while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of poly(ribitol phosphate) |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a minor form of wall teichoic acid that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Type-I-LTA
TYPES - Lipoteichoic-Acids
COMMON-NAME - type I lipoteichoic acid
COMMENT - The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.
/
/LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 13 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.
/
/LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|.
