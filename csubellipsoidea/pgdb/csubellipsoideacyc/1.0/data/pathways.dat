/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD1F-114 "<i>All-trans</i>-lycopene"| is a bright red carotenoid pigment and phytochemical found in many photosynthetic organisms. Its name is derived from the name of the tomato plant, |FRAME: TAX-4081|, in which it is found in large amounts.
/|FRAME: CPD1F-114 "<i>All-trans</i>-lycopene"| is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, which are responsible for pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photo-protection in plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms.
/
/The first committed step of carotenoid biosynthesis is that of the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12321| from |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|. This conversion is in fact a two-step reaction catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: AT5G17230-MONOMER|.
/
/In general, bacteria, fungi and plants differ in their conversion of |FRAME: CPD-12321| to |FRAME: CPD1F-114|. 
/In noncyanobacterial bacteria and fungi the pathway starts with the isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-12321| to |FRAME: PHYTOENE|, and the rest of the pathway proceeds via exclusively <i>trans</i> isomers (see |FRAME: PWY-5942|). In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, on the other hand, the pathway proceeeds via <i>cis</i> isomers, and the conversion from <i>cis</i> to <i>trans</i> occurs at the very end of the pathway, where |FRAME: CPD-7496| is converted to |FRAME: CPD1F-114| by the dedicated enzyme |FRAME: AT1G06820-MONOMER| (CrtQ in cyanobacteria).
/
/It should be noted that exceptions do occur - for example, the cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-251221| utilizes the bacterial pathway |CITS: [15811329]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In plants, algae and cyanobacteria |FRAME: CPD-12321| undergoes a series of four desaturation reactions leading to the formation of |FRAME:CPD1F-114| <i>via</i> |FRAME: CPD-7535|, |FRAME: CPD-7526| and |FRAME: CPD-7496|. To catalyze this transofrmation, plants and cyanobacteria require two phylogenetically related desaturases and two isomerases, encoded by |FRAME: AT4G14210|, |FRAME: AT1G10830|, |FRAME: AT3G04870| and |FRAME: G-9408|.
/
/The first desaturase, |FRAME: CPLX1F-15| (|FRAME: AT4G14210|), removes two hydrogens and introduces <i>trans</i> double bonds at 11 and 11', along with a <i>cis</i> bond at the 9 and 9' double bond positions, producing |FRAME: CPD-7535| which is isomerized at the 15-<i>cis</i> double bond to |FRAME: CPD-7526| by |FRAME: AT1G10830-MONOMER| (|FRAME: AT1G10830|).
/
/The downstream steps in the pathway are still under investigation. In one proposed route for |FRAME: CPD1F-114| formation, the second desaturase, |FRAME: CPLX1F-19| (|FRAME: AT3G04870|), removes two hydrogens and introduces <i>cis</i> double bonds at the 7 and 7' positions, leading to formation of conjugated <i>cis</i> double bonds at 7,9 and 7', 9'. Finally, the second isomerase, |FRAME: MONOMER-12167| (|FRAME: G-9408|), isomerizes the <i>cis</i> double bonds at 7,9 and 7', 9', producing |FRAME: CPD1F-114| |CITS: [18948076][20335404]|. The accumulation of |FRAME: CPD-7496| in <i>tangerine</i> tomato mutants |CITS: [15557094]|, as well as the biochemical activities tested for CRTISO and ZDS support the existence of this branch of the pathway |CITS: [18948076][15557094]|.
/
/However, <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic assays reveal that |FRAME: MONOMER-12167| (|FRAME: G-9408|) can also act directly on |FRAME: CPD-7524| indicating that an isomerization of this intermediate might precede the second desaturation. If this is the case, then the following reaction from |FRAME: CPD-12368| to |FRAME: CPD-12371| would be expected to be catalyzed by a ZDS enzyme. The final proposed step in this pathway has not been experimentally verified but researchers hypothesize that CRTISO would catalyze this alternate reaction that leads to the production of |FRAME: CPD1F-114| |CITS: [15557094]|. 
/
/Additional assays revealed that plants use oxidized plastoquinones as electron acceptors in the desaturation sequence.
/
/Further research will be required to determine whether different plant species use one or more of these alternative routes for producing |FRAME: CPD1F-114| <i>in vivo</i>.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|  (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent
/findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|. In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme |FRAME: GLUTDECARBOX-RXN "glutamate decarboxylase"|.
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|. Diiferent variants of both enzymes are known. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862| |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|). Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirement, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.
/
/The action of glutamate decarboxylase, &gamma;-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and succinate semialdehyde
/dehydrogenase, combined, defines a short pathway known as the "GABA shunt", since it can channel glutamate into the |FRAME: TCA|, bypassing two steps of that cycle.  
/
/While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capabillity to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria can synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation "putrescine degradation"|). 
/The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|
/|CITS:[13654294][13654295]|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This variant of the pathway includes a |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase.
/This combination of enzymes has been documented in bacteria and animals and in some plants.
/
/The  transaminase found in animals and bacteria utilizes |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|). While this form of enzyme appears to be a minor form in plants, studies of ripening tomatoes have shown that in this plant |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent activity is significantly higher (4200 times) than |FRAME:PYRUVATE|-dependent activity |CITS: [18713763]|.
/
/Regarding the hydrogenase, NAD-specific variant have been studied from many bacteria, fungi, plants and animals |CITS: [6995433][18713763][3190233]|.

/
/<b>About Pectin</b>
/
/|FRAME: Pectin "Pectin"| is one of the major components of the primary cell wall of plants. It is composed of four structurally distinct polysaccharides, namely |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl "homogalacturonan"| (HG),  rhamnogalcturonan I (RG-I), rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan "xylogalacturonan"| (XGA).
/Although all four components appear to be present in all cells, their relative abundance and structural details differ among cell types and species |CITS: [17827695]|.
/
/Pectin is synthesized in Golgi vesicles. The structural complexity of pectin suggests that a large number of enzymes is involved in the process, including glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases, acetyltransferases and feruloyltransferases.
/
/Evidence indicates a role for pectin in plant growth, development, morphogenesis, defense, cell adhesion, wall structure, signaling, cell expansion, wall porosity, binding of ions, growth factors and enzymes, pollen tube growth, seed hydration, leaf abscission, and fruit development |CITS: [15377216][11554482]|.
/
/Pectin is also used in the food and cosmetic industries, and has been shown to have several positive effects on human health |CITS: [17513886]|.
/
/<b>About Xylogalacturonan</b>
/
/|FRAME: Xylogalacturonan "Xylogalacturonan"| is a substituted |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl "homogalacturonan"| in which the &alpha;-1,4-linked |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| backbone is substituted at position O-3 with a &beta; linked |FRAME: XYLOSE|. Occasionally the xylose is further substituted at position O-4 with an additional &beta; linked xylose. The homogalacturonan backbone is partially methylesterified at the C-6 carboxyl, and may be O-acetylated at positions O-2 or O-3. 
/
/|FRAME: Xylogalacturonan "Xylogalacturonan"| has been reported to be abundant in the reproductive tissues of many plants. Recently it was reported to be present in vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis |CITS: [17336350]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CO-A "Coenzyme A"| (CoA) is a cofactor of ubiquitous occurrence in plants, bacteria, and animals needed in
/a large number of enzymatic reactions central to intermediary metabolism, including the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Coenzyme A is the common acyl carrier in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative pathways amongst others forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy metabolism |CITS: [16415216]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA is of equal importance with regard to its recognition as a target for antibacterial drug discovery and to the association of human neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.33| |CITS: [15893380]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The CoA biosynthesis precursor |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of |FRAME: VAL| (see |FRAME: VALSYN-PWY|). This compound is converted in two steps to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|, as shown in |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|.
/The latter is converted into |FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE| is two steps, involving a &beta;-alanine ligase and a kinase.
/In most organsims the ligase acts before the kinase (|FRAME: EC-6.3.2.1| followed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.33|, as described in |FRAME: PANTO-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3961|. However, in archaea the order is reversed, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.169| acts before |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.36|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6654|.
/
/The kinases are feedback inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.
/The addition of |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE|, resulting in the formation of |FRAME: R-4-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-L-CYSTEINE| (PPC), is followed by decarboxylation of PPC to |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P|. The ultimate reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.24|, which converts 4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA. All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth.
/
/The reactions in the biosynthetic route towards CoA are identical in most organisms, although there are differences in the functionality of the involved enzymes. In plants every step is catalyzed by single monofunctional enzymes, whereas in bacteria and mammals bifunctional enzymes are often employed |CITS: [16415216]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway in yeast</b>
/
/The conversion of |FRAME:R-4-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-L-CYSTEINE| to |FRAME:PANTETHEINE-P| is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.36|. In |FRAME:TAX-4932| this is a unique heterotrimeric enzyme encoded by three genes, |FRAME:YKL088W|, |FRAME:YKR072C| and |FRAME:YOR054C| which although similar in structure are irreplaceable and fulfill distinctive essential functions in the protein complex. Two of the three genes, |FRAME:YKR072C| and |FRAME:YOR054C|, are moonlighting proteins which are not only involved as PPCDC subunits in CoA biosynthesis but also known to be inhibitors/negative regulators of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase Ppz1 |CITS:[9636153][11856338][15192104]|. Hence, this enzyme complex stands as an example of cross-talks between metabolic and signaling pathways indicating the possibility of exerting regulatory influence from one pathway to another |CITS:[19915531]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many type of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CTP| is one of the building blocks of RNA. It is synthesized <i>de novo</i> from |FRAME: UTP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).
/However, when |FRAME: CMP| is available via salvage of cytidine nucleosides, it can be phosphorylated to CTP by the action of two kinases.
/
/The first phosphorylation, from |FRAME: CMP| to |FRAME: CDP|, is catalyzed in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"| and in eukaryotes by the bifunctional |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"|.
/
/The second phophorylation, from |FRAME: CDP| to |FRAME: CTP|, is catalyzed in all organisms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of GMP degradation in this pathway is the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE|, which can be degraded to |FRAME: XANTHINE| via |FRAME: GUANINE|. The enzyme that converts |FRAME: GUANOSINE| to  |FRAME: GUANINE|, guanosine deaminase, has been reported in fungi |CITS: [7551735]| and green plants |CITS: [GURANOWSKI82]|. A different route from |FRAME: GUANOSINE| to |FRAME: XANTHINE| is described in |FRAME: PWY-6607|.
/
/|FRAME: XANTHINE| is converted to |FRAME:URATE| by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|, and the latter is converted to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.
/
/This plant/fungal pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783| (EC 3.5.4.15) and instead use |FRAME: CPLX-6181| (EC 2.4.2.1) |CITS: [14725335]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).

UNIQUE-ID - PANTO-PWY
TYPES - Pantothenate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - phosphopantothenate biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - PMNCVP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE| is the universal precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of |FRAME:CO-A| and |FRAME: ACP "acyl carrier protein"|. Only plants and microorganisms (including some eukaryotic microbes, such as |FRAME: TAX-4932|) can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i> - animals require a dietary supplement. The enzymes of this pathway are therefore considered to be antimicrobial drug targets.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The starting compound for pantothenate biosynthesis, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is derived from the |FRAME: VALSYN-PWY| pathway. The first committed step in the pathway is the transfer of a methyl group to 2-keto-isovalerate by |FRAME: 3-METHYL-2-OXOBUT-OHCH3XFER-CPLX|. The product of this reaction, |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE|, is subsequently reduced by |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE-REDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|. The final step is the ATP hydrolysis-dependent condensation of L-pantoate with |FRAME: B-ALANINE| to form |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: PANTOATE-BETA-ALANINE-LIG-CPLX|.
/
/The enzymes of this pathway are not essential for viability of |FRAME: TAX-83333| grown on media supplemented with pantothenate, due to the presence of a transporter for pantothenate, PanF |CITS: [2193919]|.
/
/<b>This pathway in Yeast</b>
/
/Three out of the four reactions involved in the conversion of |FRAME:2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| to the common intermediate towards |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis, i.e. |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| have been associated with enzymes in |FRAME:TAX-4932|. The second reaction in the pathway catalyzed by the 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase in bacteria is still elusive for yeast and remains to be resolved. Utilizing genetic and biochemical approaches the functions of |FRAME:MONOMER3O-90| |CITS:[11154694] [16232925] [19266201]|, |FRAME:YIL145C-MONOMER| |CITS:[11154694] [19266201]| and |FRAME:MONOMER3O-268| |CITS:[19266201]| have been elucidated and emphasizes the general notion that the pathway sequences of |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| and |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis are almost identical among the various kingdoms.  
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants</b>
/
/Feeding studies in |FRAME:TAX-3888| leaf discs support the existence of a similar biosynthesis pathway of pantothenate via pantoate: when fed with [<sup>14</sup>C]valine, the radiolabel was incorporated into &alpha;-oxoisovalerate, oxopantoate and pantoate |CITS:[jones94]|.
/A number of enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis have been characterized from different plants, including the enzyme catalyzing the last step of the pathway: pantothenate synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of pantothenate from pantoate and &beta;-alanine. The origin of plant &beta;-alanine is uncertain but appears to be different from that of bacteria which synthesize it from L-aspartate. Instead plants seem to produce &beta;-alanine from a variety of other sources, like polyamines, uracil and propionate (see |FRAME:PWY-3941|) |CITS: [RAMAN04]|.

TYPES - Folate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - tetrahydrofolate salvage from 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis.
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.
/
/Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.
/
/Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084][SCOTT00][KIRK94]|. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.
/
/|FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>) is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|), and the number of conjugated glutamate residues  (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6612|), many of them are also capable of salvaging folate from different varieties, such as the 5,10-methenyl form, or the 5- or 10-formyl forms. This pathway describes the conversion of pre-existing |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF-GLU-N "5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate"| and |FRAME:FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| to |FRAME: THF-GLU-N "tetrahydrofolate"|.
/
/As vertebrates are not able to synthesize folate <i>in vivo</i>, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate"| and |FRAME:FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|. The polyglutamyl folates are first hydrolyzed to monoglutamate forms by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER|, and subsequently metabolized into |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF|. More about that process is found at the pathway |FRAME: PWY-2161B|.
/
/Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos |CITS: [11744531]|. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see |CITS: [11001804]|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<B>General Background</B>
/
/Sphingolipids are ubiquitous cell components present in eukaryotes and bacteria. A sphingolipid molecule is typically composed of a long-chain base (LCB, also known as sphingoid base), an amide linked fatty acyl chain, and a polar head. Ceramides (without a polar head group), glycosylceramides, and glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (GIPCs) are the predominant plant sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin, with phosphocholine as the polar head group, is the major sphingolipid in animals. Yeast contains predominantly inositolphosphoceramides (reviewed in |CITS: [Lynch04], [20028469]|.
/
/Some physiological roles of sphingolipids have been determined. Ceramides have been well known as inducers of programmed cell death in animal cells, and the same role was evidenced in plants (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). In plants, GIPCs are involved in maintaining Golgi and ER integrity, in symbiosis, and function as GPI anchors for proteins (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). Glycosylsphingolipids play roles in increasing plasma membrane stability, reducing ion permeability and pathogenesis. They were also implicated in chilling and freezing tolerance, as well as drought tolerance in plants (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). Free LCBs (sphingoids) and phosphorylated LCBs (LCB-Ps, sphingoid 1-phosphates) were implicated as mediators of cellular responses.  Like ceramides, LCBs were shown to promote programmed cell death in mammalian and plant cells. LCB-Ps were shown to be signaling intermediates in various cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). 
/
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/Ceramides are degraded by ceramidases. Ceramidases hydrolyze the N-acyl linkage between the long chain bases and the fatty acyl moieties. Ceramidases have been well characterized from human, yeast and a number of other organisms. The only characterized plant ceramidase is a rice ceramidase which however did not act with any of the predominant plant ceramides in vitro |CITS: [18547394]|. Expressing the rice ceramidase in a yeast mutant increased the yeast endogenous phytoceramide level, which indicated a reverse ceramidase activity of the rice enzyme. The in planta role of this plant ceramidase is unclear.  Free long chain bases liberated from ceramides are further degraded into corresponding aldehydes and a phosphorylethanolamine via the intermediate long chain base 1-phosphates.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| can biosynthesize |FRAME: GLY| via three different pathways.
/
/When the cells are grown with glucose as the carbon source, two alternative pathways operate. 
/In one pathway |FRAME:ENZRXN-13666|, encoded by |FRAME: YEL046C|, produces glycine from
/|FRAME:THR| (which is produced from the glycolytic intermediate oxaloacetate) (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-THR-PWY|). In the other pathway glycine is formed from |FRAME:SER| (a product of
/|FRAME: G3P|, another glycolytic intermediate) via two serine hydroxymethyltransferases - a cytosolic
/enzyme (SHMT2) and a mitochondrial enzyme (SHMT1)
/(see |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|).  The two isoforms are reported to work in opposite directions,
/depending on the culture conditions |CITS: [9398220]|.
/
/When the cells are grown with a non-fermentable carbon source, such as |FRAME:ETOH| and
/|FRAME:ACET|, glycine is produced from |FRAME: GLYOX|, a product of the
/|FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|, by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7560| (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-ALA-PWY|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME:CPLX-7560| is one of three different enzymes used for glycine synthesis in |FRAME: TAX-4932|. This enzyme is active only during growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and enables |FRAME: TAX-4932| to grow on ethanol as sole carbon source, by alleviating the need for glycolytic intermediates as the precursors for |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [14745783]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY "pentose phosphate pathway"| is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
/|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
/In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of GMP degradation in this pathway is the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE|, which is degraded to |FRAME: XANTHINE| via |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|. A different route from |FRAME: GUANOSINE| to |FRAME: XANTHINE| is described in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6606|.
/
/Studies in tea leaves and cultured |FRAME: TAX-4058| cells showed that guanosine deaminase activity was much higher than that of guanine deaminase |CITS: [Ashihara97]|, indicating that degradation of GMP via the pathway depicted here is likely to be the major route in this plant. However, the guanosine deaminase enzymatic activity has not been reported from other sources.
/
/Regardless of the exact steps leading to its formation, |FRAME: XANTHINE| is converted to |FRAME:URATE| by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|, and the latter is converted to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.

This pathway appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways as it is evolutionary conserved in all species.
/UMP is subsequently converted to other pyrimidines, as described in this pathway. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides starts with |FRAME: UMP|, and proceeds via |FRAME: UDP| to |FRAME: UTP|. |FRAME: CTP| is only formed <i>de novo</i> by deamination of |FRAME: UTP|.
/
/The first enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX|, catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP.
/The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER| |CITS: [15604701]|.
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the
/terminal phosphate of a nucleoside-triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside-diphosphate - in this case, the
/transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.
/In the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| the enzyme is encoded by a small gene family and has been demonstrated to mediate
/polar auxin transport |CITS: [15927941]| and interact with other proteins conferring stress tolerance |CITS: [12506203]|.
/
/Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is made possible by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent
/enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Phospholipids are important membrane components. Most of the phospholipids belong to the category of phosphoglycerides. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as phosphatidates, are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group.
/The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on carbon-1 and carbon-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to carbon-3 by an ester link.
/Phosphatidates are precursors for many phosphoglycerides found in animals, plants and yeast, including |FRAME: Phosphatidylinositols|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-SERINE|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN|.
/
/As part of the synthesis of phosphoglycerides, either the phosphatidate or the modifying compound need to be activated by |FRAME:CTP|. In some cases, the modifying compound is activated, as in the case of |FRAME: CHOLINE| and |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|, which form |FRAME: CDP-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: CDP-ETHANOLAMINE|, respectively. However, in the case of other compounds, such as |FRAME: SER| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, the phosphatidate is activated first, forming |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|, which then reacts with the modifying compound to form the phosphoglyceride.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| in some Gram-negative bacteria (primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|) as well as the chloroplasts of green plants. In this pathway the production of the intermediate |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P| is catalyzed by a type of the membrane-bound enzyme |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER| that uses |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| as the acyl donor.
/
/Bacteria enzymes that can utilze |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| are found only in some Gram-negative bacteria.
/They are encoded by the |FRAME: EG10740| gene, and can also utilize |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs| thioesters. The plasitidic enzyme can use only |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| |CITS: [9370311]|.
/
/The addition of the second acyl moiety is catalyzed by |FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. The bacterial enzyme, which is universally expressed in all bacteria, is encoded by |FRAME: EG11377|.
/As in the case of PlsB, it can utilize either a fatty acyl-[acp] or an acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor.
/
/A pathway that describes the usage of acyl-CoA donors can be found at |FRAME: PWY-5667|.
/It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5981|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY "pentose phosphate pathway"| is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism. It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
/|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|. Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
/In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses. The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain the redox balance, keep a
/reduced environment, fight reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and they
/are involved in the detoxification of many other toxins and stress-inducing factors (see |FRAME: PWY-4061|).
/In most organisms, the major thiol is the tripeptide |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as
/GSH), whose intracellular concentration ranges from 0.5-10 mM (see |FRAME: PWY-4041|). 
/
/Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form. For example, in |FRAME:TAX-562|, the ratio of reduced to
/oxidized glutathione is 200:1 |CITS: [11544348]|. The functionality of GSH largely depends on its being in a
/reduced form.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Oxidative damage to proteins often results in the formation of mixed disulfides within the polypetides.
/A primary defense against this damage is mediated by the action of GSH-dependent thiol-disulfide
/oxidoreductases, also called thioltransferases and best known as glutaredoxins (Grx). These proteins
/reduce the protein disulfide groups back to their native form |CITS: [ 9571241]| (an example for these
/proteins is |FRAME: RED-GLUTAREDOXIN| from |FRAME:TAX-562|).
/
/The glutaredoxins, which are oxidized during this process, are reduced back to active form with electrons
/that are donated by reduced GSH molecules.
/In this reaction, two molecules of the reduced form GSH are oxidized, condensing into the single
/molecule |FRAME: OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE|. The disulfide is reduced back into two individual GSH
/molecules by the action of the enzyme |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|.
/
/Another redox cycle involving glutathione, which is found in eukaryotic organisms, is described in
/|FRAME: PWY-4081|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE|, also known as vitamin C, fulfils multiple essential roles in both plants and animals.
/Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as an antioxidant and a redox buffer. It is also a cofactor for several enzymes, which are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.
/In plants L-ascorbate is also implicated in defense against pathogens and in control of plant growth and development.
/A significant proportion of a plants ascorbate is found in the apoplast (the aqueous solution permeating the cell walls) |CITS: [15608627]|.
/
/Under aerobic conditions L-ascorbate is oxidized in cells to |FRAME: CPD-13907 dehydroascorbate| (via the radical |FRAME: CPD-318|), which can be recycled back to ascorbate by the |FRAME: PWY-2261|. However, once formed, dehydroascorbate can be further broken down <i>in vivo</i> by irreversible reactions, escaping the  |FRAME: PWY-2261|.
/
/Several pathways for the irreversible catabolism of ascorbate have been described. Facultatively aerobic bacteria such as  |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-573| degrade L-ascorbate by different pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME: PWY-6961| and |FRAME: PWY0-301|). The anaerobic pathway begins with phosphorylation of ascorbate (mediated by a PTS-type transporter), while the aerobic pathway proceeds via |FRAME: CPD-334|. Both pathways produce |FRAME: XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE|, a centeral metabolite that is fed into the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS: [18708499]|.
/
/Plants from the |FRAME: TAX-3602| family (e.g. grapes) metabolize ascorbate to |FRAME: TARTRATE| via the intermediates |FRAME: CPD-13059| and |FRAME: L-IDONATE| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6704|). The tartrate skeleton is derived from carbons 1-4 of L-ascorbate, indicating a cleavage between carbons 4 and 5 |CITS: [Loewus99][16567629]|. 
/
/The geraniaceous plant |FRAME: TAX-1417776| metabolizes ascorbate to |FRAME: TARTRATE| and |FRAME: OXALATE| via a different pathway, with |FRAME: L-THREONATE|, rather than L-idonate, as an intermediate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6960|). In this case the tartrate skeleton is derived from carbons 3-6 of L-ascorbate, indicating a cleavage between carbons 2 and 3 |CITS:[Loewus99][15862089]|. Grapes are also known to accumulate |FRAME: OXALATE| |CITS: [DeBolt04]|, and thus may be using both pathways to generate tartrate.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-334| (DKG) is a well established degradation product of |FRAME: L-DEHYDRO-ASCORBATE| (DHA), although the pathway(s) it is involved in are not well characterized.
/A study of ascorbate degradation by human lens homogenates found that under non-oxidative conditions DHA was hydrolyzed to DKG, which was subsequently converted to |FRAME: OXALATE| and |FRAME: ERYTHRULOSE| |CITS: [10727845]|. 
/These findings contradicted an earlier study of L-ascorbate degradation into oxalate in several plants, which found that DKG was a very poor substrate for oxalate production (although it is possible that the pathways differ among plants and animals) |CITS: [16659288]|.
/
/This pathway describes the findings of a careful study that evaluated the different chemical reactions involved in DHA catabolism in the plant apoplast |CITS: [21846329]|. The study determined that DHA is a branch point in ascorbate catabolism - under oxidative conditions it is oxidized to oxalate and its esters (see |FRAME: PWY-6960|), while under non-oxidative conditions it is hydrolyzed to DKG. The oxidation:hydrolysis ratio is determined by the concentration of reactive oxygen species. 
/
/Under non-enzymatic, non-oxidative conditions, DKG was formed slowly and converted to |FRAME: CPD-13913|, which was reversibly de-lactonized to |FRAME: CPD-13912| |CITS: [21846329]|. There was little evidence for enzyme activity in the catabolism of DKG. The presence of either L-ascorbate or hydrogen peroxide supressed the formation of |FRAME: CPD-13913|, suggesting that DKG was diverted under these conditions to competing oxidative pathways.
/
/The fact that the pathway proceeds non-enzymatically suggests that it may occur in the apoplast of most, if not all plants.

COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis II
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates a route in which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: DUTP|, which are subsequently modified to other deoxyribonucleotides, including the thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. 
/While most organisms utilize a different route (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|), this pathway is found in bacteria that possess two specialized enzymes - |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.2 "ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.2)"|, an enzyme that can reduce nucleoside triphosphates to their respective deoxynucleoside triphosphates (most organism posses |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1"|, which can only accept nucleoside diphosphates), and |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 "dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13)"|, an enzyme that can deaminate |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/In this pathway the deoxyribonucleotide |FRAME: DUTP| is formed in two ways - by the direct reduction of |FRAME: UTP|, and by the deamination of |FRAME: DCTP|, which is formed from |FRAME: CTP| either directly by |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, or in two steps, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7184|.
/Once formed, |FRAME: DUTP| is dephosphorylated to |FRAME: DUMP|. Deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| is the major route for <i>de novo</i> formation of |FRAME: DUMP| in aerobically-growing |FRAME:TAX-562|. It supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| (EC 2.1.1.45).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed in this route, , |FRAME: DUTP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/At the time of this review, over 130 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA<sub>1</sub> |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|.  Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity.  Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity.  These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in |FRAME:TAX-4577| and |FRAME:TAX-3888|, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus |FRAME:TAX-5127|.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME: CPD1F-95| and |FRAME: CPD1F-134|, respectively). 
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.
/
/Given the important roles that GAs play in plant growth and development, several levels of regulation are used to carefully control the level and types of bioactive GAs present in various tissues. Direct chemical modifications to gibberellins including oxidation (see |FRAME: PWY-102|) methylation (|FRAME: PWY-6477|), and epoxidation (this pathway) may be used to reduce the levels of bioactive GAs.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Gibberellin epoxidation is believed to inactivate bioactive GAs and their precursors |CITS: [16399803]|. The existence of this pathway is supported by the identification of an enzyme from rice, |FRAME: LOC_OS05G0482400-MONOMER  "CYP714D1"|, that can catalyze GA epoxidation <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [16399803]|. In addition, there is also evidence that the transcript expression pattern of a putative 16&alpha;, 17 gibberellin epoxidase in <i>Lolium temulentum</i> may be correlated with a selective reduction in the level of active GA1 and GA4 just below the shoot apex in this species |CITS: [19825541]|. Although the epoxy forms of GA have not been detected in rice plants to date, their putative dihydroxy derivatives, such as, |FRAME: CPD-12355|, have been found in a number of plant species, including rice, |FRAME:TAX-3888|,  |FRAME:TAX-3870|, |FRAME:TAX-3750| (see refs in |CITS: [16399803]|) and <i>Lolium temulentum</i>  |CITS: [19825541]|.  Although these dihydroxy compounds can be produced spontaneously <i>in vitro</i> by exposure to acids such as acetic acid during the compound analysis process |CITS: [16399803]|, it is likely that they are also produced <i>in vivo</i> through the activity of an epoxy-hydrolase or other enzyme.
/
/Although gibberellins are produced by a number of fungi (for example, see |FRAME: PWY-5047|) and bacteria, there is no evidence to date of GA epoxide formation in these species, and it may be unlikely to occur in organisms where GA does not play a role as an endogenous signaling molecule that needs to be selectively inactivated |CITS: [19560174]|.
/
/It is interesting to note that |FRAME: LOC_OS05G0482400-MONOMER "CYP714D1"| -mediated epoxidation can occur <i>in vitro</i> both on the biologically active |FRAME: CPD1F-137| as well as the |FRAME: CPD1F-95| precursor compound that is produced very early in the GA biosynthetic pathway. This indicates that epoxidation may be used to inactivate specific GAs that are involved in particular processes, or it may be used to more globally shut down GA signaling by acting on upstream compounds. Work in additional plant species will be required to gain a better understanding of the specificity and functional role of GA epoxidation in GA metabolism. Given the important role that the |FRAME: LOC_OS05G0482400-MONOMER "CYP714D1/EUI"| GA epoxidase plays in regulating internode elongation and facilitating hybrid rice production (see refs in |CITS: [16399803]|) this mechanism of GA regulation is likely to be subject to further study.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) can occur via two distinct routes: the |FRAME: PWY-922 "mevalonate pathway"| (MVA pathway) and the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY "methylerythritol phosphate pathway"| (MEP pathway, this pathway) |CITS: [11078528]|. In the former, IPP is synthesized from the condensation of  three acetyl-CoA molecules; in the MEP pathway IPP is synthesized via the condensation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|.
/
/For many years, the MVA pathway was considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms. However, several inconsistencies led to the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.
/In plants the MVA pathway is located in the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS:[LICHTENTHALER97]|. The MEP pathway is present in most eubacteria, unicellular green algae, the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms and some unicellular eukaryotes related to photosynthetic phyla, such as the Plasmodium parasites |CITS: [15473867]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP "Isopentenyl diphosphate"| (IPP) and its isomer |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are produced from |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via this pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DOXP). DOXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, |FRAME: 2-C-METHYL-D-ERYTHRITOL-4-PHOSPHATE| (MEP). 
/Interestingly, two rather different enzymes, that share no sequence homology, are able to catalyze this reaction - the |FRAME: DXPREDISOM-CPLX "DXR"| enzymes, and the |FRAME:MONOMER-15827 "DRL"| (DXR-like) enzymes |CITS: [20660776]|.
/
/In the third reaction MEP is converted into |FRAME: 4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C|, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding
/|FRAME: 2-PHOSPHO-4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C-MET|. This product is then converted into
/|FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. Subsequently, it is reduced to generate |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| |CITS: [12198182]|.
/
/This diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP in the final step. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER|. IPP and DMAPP serve as the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  
/
/The difference between this pathway variant and the variant described in |FRAME: PWY-7560| is the conversion of |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| to |FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. In this variant, that enzyme utilizes flavodoxin as the electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.3|), while in the other variant the enzyme utilizes ferredoxin (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.1|).
/
/This pathway, which is not present in humans, is involved in production of phosphate-containing antigens recognized by &gamma;-&delta; T lymphocytes |CITS: [11675382]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that contains a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/Lipoate is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes involved in oxidative metabolism, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, the |FRAME: PWY-5084| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, the |FRAME: PWY-5046| |CITS: [2188967]|, and the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY| |CITS: [1655709][8444795]|.
/
/Each of these enzyme complexes is composed of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific
/decarboxylase-dehydrogenase (<i>E<sub>1</sub></i>), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (<i>E<sub>2</sub></i>)
/specific for each type of complex, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (<i>E<sub>3</sub></i>). 
/The (<i>E<sub>2</sub></i>) proteins have a dedicated lipoyl domain. In order for the complex to be active, lipoate must be attached to the lipoyl domain by an amide linkage between its carboxylate moiety and a specific lysine residue in the enzyme |CITS: [8444795]|.
/
/<i>E<sub>1</sub></i> catalyzes a reaction in which the substrate is attached to the lipoate cofactor and decarboxylated. During this reaction, the lipoate cofactor is reduced to dihydriolipoate.
/<i>E<sub>2</sub></i> then catalyzes an acyl transfer step, in which the product of the reaction is released. Finally, <i>E<sub>3</sub></i> catalyzes the oxidation of the dihydrolipoyl cofactor back to lipoyl form, with NAD being the ultimate electron acceptor |CITS: [2188967]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of lipoate is unusual, and shares the same mechanism as the biosynthesis of biotin.
/The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain, and is then converted to lipoate.
/
/The first enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME:EG11591-MONOMER|, transfers the octanoate moiety from
/|FRAME: Octanoyl-ACPs "octanoate-[acp]"| molecule to a specific lysyl residue in lipoate-dependent enzymes, resulting in |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|, and regenerating the acyl-carrier protein in the process |CITS: [8002607]
/[14700636]|. |FRAME:EG11591-MONOMER|-mediated attachment of octanoate to the apo-domain probably does
/not occur unless the octanoate is bound to an acyl-carrier protein. 
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME:CPLX0-782|, catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain.
/The enzyme is an iron-sulfur protein that requires S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) |CITS: [8444795][11106496]|.
/An electron which originates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme serves to split at least two
/molecules of AdoMet into a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine |CITS: [11834738]|.
/The radical then abstracts a hydrogen from a C-H bond of thew octanoyl side chain, becoming
/5'-adenosine in the process. 
/The newly-formed unstable octanoyl radical then reacts directly with the Fe-S center of the enzyme.
/Two sulfur atoms from the center enter the structure of the octanoyl side chain, producing lipoyl, which
/dissociates from the enzyme along with excess iron, leaving it with a [2Fe-2S] center.
/Thus, in this unusual reaction, the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme is not just a catalytic accelerator, but
/also a substrate, donating the two sulfur atoms |CITS: [11153271]|. 
/It should be noted that although this process has been well documented <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [11106496]|,
/there is still a possibility that there exists another sulfur donor <i>in vivo</i>, and that the Fe-S center
/acts as sulfur donor only in the absence of this natural donor |CITS: [11395404]|.
/
/It has been suggested that the conversion of octanoylated-domains to lipoylated ones described
/in this pathway may be a type of a repair pathway, activated only if the other lipoate
/biosynthetic pathways are malfunctioning |CITS: [14700636]|.
/
/Other routes for lipoate incorporation involve the lipoyl-protein ligase LplA, which utilizes either lipoate
/or octanoate imported from outside the cell (see |FRAME: PWY0-522| and |FRAME:PWY0-1275|).
/
/<b>Lipoate Biosynthesis in Other Organisms</b>
/
/Genes encoding LipA and LipB have been identified in mammalian genomes and it has been shown that
/mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID| in mitochondria |CITS: [11389890]|.
/However, their significance is not fully understood because it is generally believed that mammals
/primarily rely on salvaged |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| (see |FRAME: PWY0-522|).
/Lipoate biosynthesis has also been demonstrated in plants |CITS: [10671542]|.
/
/It is not clear whether Archaea utilize lipoate. No clear evidence is available, although the genes
/encoding a putative 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex have been reported in |FRAME: TAX-2246|
/|CITS: [10832633]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Many organisms possess enzymes for the transformation of |FRAME: UREA| into |FRAME: AMMONIA|
/and |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/This conversion can occur in two distinct routes, catalyzed by the enzymes |FRAME: CPLX-6897|
/and |FRAME:ENZRXN3O-319|, respectively.
/
/
/Urease catalyzes the ATP independent cleavage of the amide bonds of urea, forming
/|FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE| in a single step. Ureases have been described
/in plants, fungi, and bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY-5704|).
/
/|FRAME:ENZRXN3O-319| (also known as urea amidolyase) enzymes have been known for quite a while
/in yeast and algae |CITS: [5679987][6753831][4556303]|, and more recently were found in bacteria
/|CITS: [15090492]|. All of these organisms lack a urease.
/Urea amidolyase catalyzes the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of |FRAME: UREA| to |FRAME: AMMONIA|
/and carbonic acid with |FRAME: CPD-578| (allophanate) as an intermediate.
/The overall reaction consists of two independent enzymatic reactions |CITS: [4571226]| -
/the carboxylation of urea, followed by hydrolysis of |FRAME: CPD-578| to |FRAME: AMMONIA| and
/|FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/
/While in yeast both activities are performed by a single polypeptide |CITS:[1802034][6105114][6124544]|,
/in algae they are catalyzed by two separate enzymes, urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698179972:bxue
COMMENT - The arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway is widely distributed among prokaryotic organisms. It has been detected in many organisms, including lactic bacteria |CITS: [10359490][10733246][15939575]|, Bacilii |CITS: [4436643][690081]|, |FRAME:TAX-286| species |CITS: [6438064][3129535]|, |FRAME:TAX-642| species |CITS: [6303241]|, Clostridia |CITS: [12999794][5335895]|, |FRAME:TAX-2093| secies |CITS: [5911610][126306][6438064][3806049]|, Sterptococci |CITS: [2843090][12406748]|, |FRAME:TAX-2132| secies |CITS: [Igwebe78]|, Spirochaetes |CITS: [977548]|, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [100070]|.  It was also demonstrated in the halophylic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2242| |CITS: [5903088]|.
/In addition, the pathway is also present in some primitive eukaryotic protozoans, including |FRAME: TAX-5722| |CITS: [6312311]|, |FRAME: TAX-56690| |CITS: [7866382]|, |FRAME: TAX-28002| |CITS: [12706792]|, and |FRAME: TAX-5741|, in which it plays a significant role in energy metabolism, providing a route for anaerobic substrate level phosphorylation |CITS: [2228433]|. 
/
/The enzymes of this pathway have also been found in |FRAME: ORG-5993|, and it was shown that |FRAME:TAX-3701| chloroplasts can metabolize arginine and citrulline all the way to CO<sub>2</sub>.  However, since |FRAME:TAX-3701|
/rarely encounters exogenous arginine or citrulline, it is assumed that in this organism this pathway may serve as a means for extracting nitrogen from endogenous sources |CITS: [8278506]|.
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway use the enzyme arginine deiminase to convert arginine to |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|. Citrulline is degraded further (see |FRAME: CITRULLINE-DEG-PWY|), forming ATP, |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|, and |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [8759859] [10733246]|. The arginine deiminase pathway provides the organisms with energy, carbon, and nitrogen. In addition, it has been suggested that the pathway can also protect some bacteria from acidic conditions, by the production of ammonia.
/Indeed, the arginine deiminase system can function at very low pH.  For example, in |FRAME: TAX-2133| FA-1, the pH at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full pH unit below the minimum for glycolysis (pH 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (pH 4.7) |CITS: [2843090]|.  The arginine deiminase pathway is thought to be a critical factor in oral biofilm pH homeostasis that may inhibit the emergence of a cariogenic flora |CITS: [11094270]|.
/
/The genes encoding the enzymes of this pathway are often found in an operon, which may also include the <i>arcD</i> gene, encoding a membrane-bound arginine-ornithine antiporter, as well as a putative aminopeptidase-encoding <i>arcT</i> gene and a regulator-encoding <i>arcR</i> gene |CITS: [1311296][9696763][12450828]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| is a key substrate in glycoprotein formation.
/In eukaryotes, |FRAME:MANNOSE| is a key monosaccharide for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids.
/
/Mannose-containing glycoconjugates, such as protein <i>N-</i> and <i>C-</i>glycans, some
/<i>O</i>-glycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein membrane anchors, and some glycolipids,
/have a variety of important functions. These functions include the promotion of correct folding, solubility,
/stability and intracellular sorting of proteins, promoting the enzymatic, hormonal or receptor activity of
/many proteins, and the formation of cell surface glycocalyces, extracellular matrices and protective cell
/walls. In addition, glycoproteins are known to play major roles in cell-cell interactions
/(see |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS|) |CITS: [11447107]|.
/
/|FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| is the critical metabolite of the mannose activation pathway for

/
/In addition, |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| is a precursor for the biosynthesis of several important

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As shown in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7199|, the deoxyribonucleosides are imported into the cell and phosphorylated by deoxyribonucleoside kinases at the 5' position. The monophosphates are then phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis, as described in this pathway. 
/
/|FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 "dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"|.
/
/Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols such as glutathione play several major roles in the cell, including maintainance of the redox
/balance, fighting reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and the detoxification of many other toxins and
/stress-inducing factors (see |FRAME: PWY-4061|).
/In most organisms the major thiol is the tripeptide |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly,

/
/Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form. For example, in |FRAME:TAX-562|, the ratio of
/reduced to oxidized glutathione is 200:1 |CITS: [11544348]|. The functionality of GSH largely depends on
/its being in a reduced form.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/One of the main roles of glutathione in the cell is the reduction of other molecules, such as peroxides
/or protein-disulfide groups. In this pathway the process is represnted by |FRAME: EC-1.11.1.12|:
/
/|FRAME:1.11.1.12-RXN|
/

/
/In the process two molecules of GSH are condensed into a single molecule of the oxidized form,
/|FRAME: OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE|.
/In eukaryotes this oxidation reaction is often catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the glutathione
/peroxidase family.
/It was believed that glutathione-dependent peroxidases are not present in prokaryotic organisms, but
/recently some glutathione-dependent peroxidases have been discovered in bacteria |CITS: [12606554]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Phospholipids are important membrane components. The major phospholipids of |FRAME:TAX-562| are phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols and cardiolipin.
/All phospholipids contain <I>sn</I>-glycerol-3-phosphate esterified with fatty acids at the <I>sn</I>-1 and <I>sn</I>-2 positions. 
/
/In addition to providing the membrane matrix, phospholipids are also involved in synthesizing several types of surface molecules. The phosphoethanolamine head groups of phosphatidylethanolamine are transferred and attached to the 
/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core sugars and to periplasmic membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) |CITS: [2404013] [ColiSalII]|.
/
/At least three different pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE| in plants:
/The decarboxylation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5669|), the |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| transfer pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-6|), and the base (head group) exchange pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6273|).
/The phosphoethanolamine transfer pathway is believed to be the major pathway in plants.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes. They are also
/determinants of intracellular communication in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|
/and protein modification, where fatty acyl moieties of proteins modify their location and function
/|CITS: [10446384]|.
/
/|FRAME: PALMITATE Palmitate| is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in animals and plants.
/It was discovered by Edmond Fremy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major component, and hence its name.
/Palmitate is synthesized by stepwise condensation of C2 units to a growing acyl chain. Each elongation cycle results in the addition of two carbons to the acyl chain, and consists of four separate reactions. The first step is the condensation of a C2 unit with the nascent [acp]-bound acyl, forming a |FRAME: B-KETOACYL-ACP| and releasing CO<sub>2</sub>. This step is followed by reduction to |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP|, and a final reduction to form the elongated fatty acid-[acp]. This chain of event repeats itself several times, until the final product, |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|, is formed.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis systems, named type I and type II.
/The type I system is found in animals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see |FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex (see |FRAME: CPLX-7627| from |FRAME: TAX-4932|).
/The pathway catalyzed by the type I systems is available at |FRAME: PWY-5994|.
/
/Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|.
/The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
/
/Unlike the type I system that accepts |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| as the source of the two-carbon units, the type II systems accept only |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|. The final product of the pathway is |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl group bound to the acyl-carrier protein"|. It is released from the [acp] moiety and converted to a free acid or a CoA-derivative.
/
/In plant systems |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"| is often extended to form |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| (see |FRAME: PWY-5989|). Thus, in most plants the primary products of fatty acid biosynthesis are both |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"| (16:0-ACP) and |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| (18:0-ACP). In addition, the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7072|, which is ubiquitous in plants, introduces the first double bond in |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| (while still bound to ACP), producing |FRAME: Oleoyl-ACPs oleoyl-acp|. The palmitate and oleate products can either be utilized within the plastid for lipid assembly and further desaturation, or exported to allow further desaturation in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as incorporation into lipids.
/The fatty acids that are exported out of the chloroplast are first cleaved from ACP by thioesterases, followed by activation to fatty acyl-CoAs by an outer envelope |FRAME: AT1G77590| activity. Once activated to acyl-CoAs, they are exported to the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [14973169]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:RIBOFLAVIN "Riboflavin"| is the precursor for the essential flavin cofactors |FRAME:FMN| and |FRAME:FAD|, which are used in a wide variety of redox reactions. Riboflavin is also known as vitamin B2, because it is an essential nutrient and can not be synthesized by mammals.
/
/The biosynthesis of one riboflavin molecule requires one molecule of |FRAME: GTP| and two molecules of
/|FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| as substrates.
/The imidazole ring of GTP is hydrolytically opened, yielding a 4, 5-diaminopyrimidine which is converted to
/|FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| by a sequence of deamination, side chain reduction
/and dephosphorylation. Condensation of |FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| with
/|FRAME: DIHYDROXY-BUTANONE-P| obtained from |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| results in the formation of
/|FRAME: DIMETHYL-D-RIBITYL-LUMAZINE|.
/Dismutation of the lumazine derivative yields |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN| and
/|FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE|, which is recycled in the pathway |CITS: [10940330]|.
/
/The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway and its enzymes are well understood, although the enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: CPD-1086| has been identified only recently |CITS: [24123841]|. 
/
/Several bifunctional enzymes are involved in this pathway in |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1423|.
/One bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the two steps required for converting |FRAME: DIAMINO-OH-PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINO-PYR| to |FRAME: CPD-1086|. Another such enzyme catalyzes the last two steps of the pathway, |FRAME:ENZRXN-16078| and |FRAME:ENZRXN-16079|.
/
/In addition, in both |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |FRAME: CPLX-7778| is a bifunctional enzyme complex
/that catalyzes the two steps leading from |FRAME:AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| and
/|FRAME:DIHYDROXY-BUTANONE-P| to |FRAME:RIBOFLAVIN| via |FRAME:DIMETHYL-D-RIBITYL-LUMAZINE|.
/This complex consists of a core of three &alpha; subunits and 60 &beta; subunits arranged in an icosahedral
/capsid around the &alpha; trimer in the central core |CITS: [7473709]|.
/
/Different variations of the pathway are found in the different kingdoms of life.
/The enzymes catalyzing the fungal pathway are similar to the bacterial/plant ones, but there is a difference in the order in which they act. Two enzymatic steps are required to convert |FRAME: DIAMINO-OH-PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINO-PYR| to |FRAME: CPD-1086| - a demaination and a reduction.
/In bacteria and plants, the deaminase acts first, followed by the reductase (although both steps are catalyzed by a single
/bifunctional enzyme in some organisms) |CITS: [15208317]|, while in fungi the reductase acts first, followed by the deaminase (see |FRAME: PWY-6168|). The archaeal pathway also differs in several steps (see |FRAME: PWY-6167|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| is a nucleotide sugar involved in the synthesis of diverse plant cell wall hemicelluloses (xyloglucan, xylan) and minor plant metabolites. It is also required for the synthesis of glycoproteins, animal proteoglycans and fungal polysaccharides (for review see |CITS:[12481102]|). 
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>
/
/ In plants, the biosynthesis of |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| occurs both in the cytosol and in membrane-bound compartments.  The major biosynthesis route occurs through the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-12575| (UDP-Glc).  This conversion involves two enzymatic steps: the oxidation of |FRAME: CPD-12575| to |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| (UDP-GlcA) by a |FRAME: MGI:1306785-MONOMER| and the subsequent decarboxylation to |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| by a |FRAME: AT3G53520-MONOMER|. Regulation of these enzymes is important in understanding the partitioning of carbon into hemicellulose away from starch, sucrose and cellulose, which are irreversible processes.  Biochemical evidence suggests that the timing of expression of |FRAME: MGI:1306785-MONOMER| and to some extent that of |FRAME: AT3G53520-MONOMER| may control the flux of carbon into hemicellulose in vascular differentiating tissues.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/  In plants, two different types of UDP-Glc dehydrogenases have been identified so far: the first type, exemplified by the UDP-Glc dehydrogenase isolated from soybean nodules |CITS:[8938413]|, has a unique catalytic activity towards UDP-Glc (EC 1.1.1.22); the second type exemplified by the mammalian-like tobacco dehydrogenase |CITS:[15821883]| has dual dehydrogenase activities towards UDP-Glc (EC 1.1.1.22) and ethanol (EC 1.1.1.1).  Similarly, biochemical analysis of UDP-glucuronate decarboxylases suggests that this enzyme may come in different forms |CITS:[15821883]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Bacteria:</b>
/

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and
/mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states.
/These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine,
/formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.17| (encoded in |FRAME:TAX-562| by |FRAME:EG10327|) adds a glutamate residue to 7,8-dihydropteroate, resulting in 7,8-dihydrofolate, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>.
/This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-ENZRXN| (FolA) to tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF).
/THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]| (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|).
/
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
/folate polyglutamtes (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates).  Most of the glutamates are added by
/&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
/or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
/peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized
/dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/Apparently, the glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell,
/it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in
/mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis
/|CITS: [10598551]|.
/Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl
/counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain length |CITS: [2688305]|.
/At least in one case, the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-independent methionine synthetase, there is an absolute
/requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor |CITS: [2985605]|.
/
/In addition, many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without
/achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain
/can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which
/controls biosynthetic pathways |CITS: [2688305]|.
/
/
/Folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folates to
/polyglutamates, has been purified from several organisms, including |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [2985605]|.
/It is a MgATP-dependent enzyme present in all cells. FPGS forms a complex with MgATP, a folate derivative,
/and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially |CITS: [11501996]|.
/In |FRAME:TAX-562|, FPGS is a bi-functional enzyme, which also catalyzes the addition of glutamate
/to 7,8-dihydropteroate, generating 7,8,-dihydrofolate (dihydrofolate synthetase, (E.C# 6.3.2.12).
/
/In exponentially growing cells of |FRAME:TAX-562| folylpoly-&gamma;- glutamates have short glutamate chain lengths:
/mono- and triglutamate derivatives are most abundant, with tetra-, penta- and hexaglutamate derivatives
/also present (in order of decreasing abundance). However, in stationary phase, cells contain longer-chain-length
/folypolyglutamates, with the predominant chain length containing six or seven  glutamyl residues.
/These longer chains are generated by a second enzyme, which adds glutamate moieties in &alpha;-linkage to
/tetrahydropteroyl- triglutamates |CITS: [3536926]|. However, this enzyme has not been purified,
/nor has the gene encoding it been identified. 
/
/Both folylpolyglutamate synthetases can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that
/the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-THF
/(10-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>), while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate
/residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-methylene-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>2</sub>).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by photorespiration, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms (see |FRAME: PWY-6963|). The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes (this pathway). 
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

/
/Many metabolic processes, including respiration, photosynthetic electron transport and oxidation of glycolate in photorespiration, generate reactive oxygen species such as singleton oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. 
/For example, the univalent reduction of dioxygen in illuminated chloroplasts produces superoxide anion radicals, which are disproportionate to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen by the superoxide dismutase enzyme, contained in the stroma
/and lumen. These highly reactive compounds can damage membrane lipids and certain enzymes and thus interrupt cell function.
/
/The ascorbate-glutathione cycle performs the scavenging of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. In this cycle, |FRAME: ASCORBATE| and |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| transfer reducing power from NADPH to hydrogen peroxide, reducing it to water. 
/The reduction of hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by |FRAME: MONOMER-5127|, in a reaction that generates |FRAME: CPD-318|, a radical that can be reduced to ascorbate by |FRAME: MONOMER-5129|. If not reduced rapidly, monodehydroascorbate is disproportionated into |FRAME: ASCORBATE| and |FRAME: L-DEHYDRO-ASCORBATE|, and the latter is reduced back to |FRAME: ASCORBATE| by |FRAME: MONOMER-5132| using |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| as the reducing agent. The oxidized glutathione is reduced by |FRAME: MONOMER-5145| using NADPH (see |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|).
/
/The ascorbate-glutathione cycle presents in at least four different subcellular locations including the cytosol, chloroplast, mitochondrion and peroxisome. Studies of the Arabidopsis enzymes of the pathway show that the same set of enzymes, including |FRAME: MONOMER-5127|, |FRAME: MONOMER-5129| and |FRAME: MONOMER-5145|, are dual targeted to chloroplast and mitochondrion |CITS: [12954611]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor. However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be |FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal acceptor, which could be oxygen in the case of aerobic respiration, or another type of molecule in anaerobic respiration. 
/
/Known terminal acceptors include organic compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|), or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|, |FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|, |FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold, |FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the membrane due to three potential processes:
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit |FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are formed in the glycolytic and TCA cycles. Each of these energy-rich molecules has a pair of electrons with high transfer potential. The free energy liberated during transfer of those electrons can be used for synthesizing ATP. This electron transfer is performed by a series of four large electron carriers complexes also known as complex I-IV (electron transport chain or respiratory chain), present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These complexes facilitate the passage of electrons from lower to higher redox potentials. Of those complexes, complex I and II are involved in the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The flow of electrons resulting from this oxidation causes protons to be pumped from the matrix side to the intermembrane space. This flow generates a proton-motive force composed of a pH gradient and a membrane potential. Those protons flow back into the matrix through various routes. Particularly, protons flow back through the ATP-synthesizing complex embedded in the mitochondrial membrane leading to the synthesis of ATP. Aerobic respiration parallels the transport of electrons resulting from the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> with the creation of a proton gradient and accompanying membrane potential, leading to the synthesis of ATP |CITS: [DEY97]|.
/
/In contrast to the mitochondrial respiration in mammals and plants (this pathway), the oxidative phosphorylation in |FRAME: TAX-4932| via the respiration chain occurs without complex I. Instead Baker's yeast employs three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (type II - one internal, two external) which catalyze the reoxidation of cytosolic |FRAME:NADH| to provide |FRAME:NAD| (see |FRAME:PWY-7279|) |CITS:[23086143] [1900238] [9733747] [9696750]|.

In addition to its role in proteins, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines.
/
/In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.
/
/The nitrogen and carbon skeleton of methionine comes from homoserine, the sulfur atom from cysteine, and the methyl group from folate. Methionine biosynthesis in plants differs from that in microorganisms. O-phospho-homoserine, instead of O-succinyl-homoserine, is the intermediate converting homoserine to cystathionine. In addition, plants can utilize 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, S-methylmethionine, or S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donors in converting homocysteine to methionine.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: L-Fucopyranoses| is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms.  It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins (such as the human antigenic glycoproteins or glycolipids of erythrocyte membranes) and various plant cell wall polysaccharides.  It is found in xyloglucans and rhamnogalacturonans I and II.  Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE| (GDP-Fuc) as the donor substrate.
/
/The formation of |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE| occurs via two routes: a) a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route from |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| (this pathway), and b) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-Fuc from free |FRAME: L-Fucopyranoses| (|FRAME:PWY-6|).  
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of GDP-Fuc from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) comprises three catalytic steps: a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction.  The first reaction step is catalyzed by |FRAME: GDPMANDEHYDRA-CPLX|, which involved the formation of the intermediate |FRAME: GDP-4-DEHYDRO-6-DEOXY-D-MANNOSE|.  In |FRAME: TAX-3702|, the |FRAME: AT3G51160| encodes a protein which was shown to possess this catalytic activity.  In bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-562|), fungi (|FRAME: TAX-64518|), plants (|FRAME: TAX-3702|) and humans, the second and third reactions steps have been shown to be catalyzed by a single bifunctional polypeptide: |FRAME: CPLX0-3881| |CITS:[12881408][9525924][8910301][20035716]|.  The coexpression of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |FRAME: AT3G51160| and |FRAME: AT1G73250| (encoding for |FRAME: AT1G73250-MONOMER|) genes in yeast cells led to the production of GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man |CITS:[12881408]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of GMP degradation is the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE|, which can be degraded to |FRAME: XANTHINE| in two ways (via |FRAME: GUANINE| or |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|) depending on the order in which a deaminase and a nucleosidase act.
/
/Studies in tea leaves and cultured |FRAME: TAX-4058| cells showed that guanosine deaminase activity was much higher than that of guanine deaminase |CITS: [Ashihara97]|. It indicates the degradation pathway of GMP via xanthosine is likely to be the major route in this plant. However, the guanosine deaminase enzymatic activity has not been reported from other sources.
/Regardless of the exact steps leading to its formation, |FRAME: XANTHINE| is converted to |FRAME:URATE| by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|, and the latter is converted to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.
/
/The plant pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783| (EC 3.5.4.15) |CITS: [14725335]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6353|).

/Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC|, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The thiol redox system of |FRAME:TAX-562| consists of the thioredoxin pathway (shown here) and the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway (see |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|).  Electrons from |FRAME: NADPH| flow through these pathways via gradients in redox potentials.  Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin reduce disulfide bonds by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism involving two active site cysteine residues in the motif CXXC (where X is any amino acid) that form either a disulfide or a dithiol.  In addition to the importance of thiol redox potential |CITS: [10464247]|, other important factors in the thiol redox system are cellular location |CITS: [9724776]| and the overall redox state of the cell.  Both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways appear to operate in parallel.  Genetic studies in |FRAME:TAX-562| have shown the two pathways to be functionally redundant during aerobic growth, although inactivation of both pathways results in unviability.  Reviewed in |CITS: [17659286] [18423382] [11544348]|.  
/
/The thioredoxin pathway is involved in reducing important cytoplasmic enzymes such as the essential ribonucleotide reductase, as well as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B.  |FRAME:TAX-562| thioredoxin also binds to bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and serves as its processivity factor for polymerization during phage growth  (|CITS: [20080681]| and in |CITS: [9440688]|).  In addition, many other proteins that may interact with thioredoxin have been identified |CITS: [15502869] [15004283]|.  Thioredoxin is also involved in a pathway for the trans-membrane transfer of reducing potential from the cytoplasm to the periplasm to reduce the protein disulfide isomerase DbsC |CITS: [9352906] [19258316]|.  After acting as a reductant, disulfide-containing oxidized thioredoxin is reduced back to a dithiol by thioredoxin reductase, an FAD-containing, NADPH-dependent enzyme.   Reviewed in |CITS: [17659286]|.  
/
/The thiol redox system is present in taxonomic groups from archaea to man.  However, despite structural and mechanistic similariteis between prokaryotic and eukaryotic thiol redox systems, their overall cellular functions differ (reviewed in |CITS: [17659286]| and |CITS: [11012661]|). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway diagram, clicking on the protein class named "a reduced thioredoxin" will display a page showing two instances of this class named reduced thioredoxin 2 and reduced thioredoxin 1.  These proteins are the products of |FRAME:TAX-562| genes <i>trxC</i> and  <i>trxA</i>, respectively.  Clicking on either of the instance names will display a page showing some structural and functional properties of the respective protein.
/
/Again in the pathway diagram, clicking on the protein class named "an oxidized thioredoxin" will display a page showing two instances of this class named oxidized thioredoxin 1 and oxidized thioredoxin 2.  Note that in the gene-reaction schematic shown on this page the reduced thioredoxins are considered to be the direct gene products and their oxidized forms are shown separately as modified forms of the gene products.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| TrxA is a more well studied thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase than TrxC (Trx2).  TrxC was identified later as a novel thioredoxin that forms a subfamily of the TrxA protein family.  The gene encoding TrxC is under control of the transcriptional regulator OxyR which responds to oxidative stress, although the biological role of TrxC remains to be fully elucidated |CITS: [9388228] [12952960]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A), which is present in all eukaryotic cells, must be activated by post translational modification before it can participate in the initiation of protein synthesis. 
/The modification involves the addition of a |FRAME: BUTYLAMINE| residue (derived from |FRAME: SPERMIDINE|) to a highly conserved lysine in the eIF-5A protein |CITS: [11278418]|. This results in the formation of an unusual amino acid called |FRAME: CPD-9974|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9974| occurs exclusively within the eIF-5A precursor, and is catalyzed by two enzymatic steps, |FRAME: MONOMER-13914| (DHS) and |FRAME: HS05318-MONOMER| (DOHH) |CITS: [10542236]|. 
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9974| is found in all eukaryotes and the DHS and DOHH enzymes are highly conserved, indicating that the fundamental cellular function of elF5A is maintained from plants to mammals. DHS enzymes have been isolated and characterized from several animals and plants. The second enzyme (DOHH) has been charaterized from mammals, and homologs were identified in the |FRAME: TAX-3701| and |FRAME: TAX-4527| genomes.
/
/In tomato there is an increase in the abundance of DHS mRNA as well as elf5A mRNA in senescing flowers and fruits and in environmentally stressed leaves, suggesting that this enzyme plays a role in programmed cell death |CITS: [11278418]|. The antisense suppression of deoxyhypusine synthase in tomato dealys fruit softening and alters growth and development |CITS: [15951486]|.
/
/The strict substrate specificity for hypusine modification provides possible drug targeting of these enzymes, particularly in aberrant cell proliferation |CITS: [17476569]|.

TYPES - Adenosine-Nucleotides-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - adenosine nucleotides degradation I
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of AMP degradation is the conversion of AMP to IMP, which is converted to xanthine in two alternative routes, via |FRAME: XANTHOSINE| or |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|. 
/
/The product of this pathway, |FRAME: URATE|, is converted to to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.
/
/The plant pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783| (EC 3.5.4.15) |CITS: [14725335]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6353|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier
/in membranes.
/In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions
/in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase)
/or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (<i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex).
/The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|, while the
/isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|,
/which feeds isoprene units into the |FRAME: Polyprenyl-Biosynthesis| pathways.
/
/The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example,
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 such subunits, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and
/|FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10. The ubiquinones are often named according to the number of carbons in
/the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).
/
/Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the product (4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate), is processed
/in three steps, namely decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic
/pathways differ in the order of these steps: in eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated
/prior to decarboxylation; in prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation
/and methylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.
/
/The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that
/accumulate pathway intermediates; some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically
/characterized.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: UBIQUINONE-9| (Q-9) has been reported in different types of eukaryotic organisms.
/
/It is the only quinone found in many animals, including the common mammals mouse
/(|FRAME: TAX-10090|) and rat (|FRAME: TAX-10116|), the fish |FRAME: TAX-283036| (walleye), the
/worm |FRAME: TAX-6239| |CITS: [17482885]|, and certain insects, such as the house fly
/(|FRAME: TAX-7370|) and the cabbage white butterfly |FRAME: TAX-64459| |CITS: [13673033]|.
/
/Q-9 is also synthesized by several fungal species. It has been found in the |FRAME: TAX-5204| species
/|FRAME: TAX-200324|, |FRAME:TAX-336994| and |FRAME:TAX-198662| |CITS: [Sugiyama88]|, and the
/|FRAME:TAX-4890| species |FRAME: TAX-4903| |CITS: [13673033]| and |FRAME: TAX-4952|
/|CITS: [3983092]|.
/A recent study of the distribution of quinones in fungi belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-5042|,
/|FRAME: TAX-33183|, and related genera, found that organisms belonging to the genus
/|FRAME: TAX-5086| and |FRAME: TAX-5104|, as well as members of the |FRAME: TAX-34384| family,
/contain Q-9 |CITS: [10768477]|.
/
/In addition, Q-9 is found in plants, including |FRAME:TAX-3702| |CITS:[12437513][15784989]| and in algae,

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays important roles in many aspects of metabolism. In plants, 
/like in animals, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA feeds into the TCA cycle for the generation of energy and 
/reducing power. In the plastid, acetyl-CoA serves as a substrate for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In 
/the plant cell cytosol, acetyl-CoA, its derivative malonyl-CoA to be precise, is a precursor for the 
/synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and many secondary metabolites including flavonoids and terpenoids. 
/The distinct pools of acetyl-CoA are generated via different biosynthetic routes in plants.  
/The mitochondrial and plastid acetyl-CoA pools are derived from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase 
/complex (see pathway |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|), whereas, the cytosolic pool is derived from 
/citrate and ATP, catalyzed by ATP-citrate lyase. 
/
/Besides plants, the pathway for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis from cirate, illustrated here, also occurs in vertebrates. 
/In vertebrates, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol genesis are cytosolic processes. The 
/acetyl-CoA synthesized from citrate in the cytosol feeds into these processes.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/While the amino acid |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| is not involved
/directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways, such as
/the |FRAME:PWY-4984| and the biosynthesis of several compounds, including arginine
/(see |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY| and |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), proline (see |FRAME:PWY-3341|
/and |FRAME:PWY-4981|), and putrescine (|FRAME:PWY-46|), which leads to the biosynthesis of other
/polyamines and pyrimidines.  It is also involved in |FRAME: PWY-6818|.
/
/This pathway documents the synthesis of |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| from |FRAME:GLT| via
/<i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the
/spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis (see
/|FRAME:PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to arginine and proline separate
/(|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein). 
/
/Two alternative pathways have evolved, which differ in the way the key intermediate
/|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed, and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another
/intermediate, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|.
/In this pathway, which is less common, NAG is formed by NAG synthase, and
/|FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase,
/forming |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: ACET|.
/In the other pathway (see |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and
/eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is
/removed from |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto |FRAME: GLT|, regenerating
/|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This ornithine biosynthesis pathway has been found in the |FRAME:TAX-543|

/the |FRAME: TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-34|
/|CITS: [ 9829957]|, and the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|.
/In it |FRAME: GLT| is acetylated to NAG by the enzyme
/|FRAME:N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10063| gene.
/The acetyl donor for this reaction is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In plants and algae nitrate is an important source of nitrogen. Nitrate assimilation begins with the uptake of nitrate from the soil by the root. Root epidermal and cortical cells are the first to actively transport nitrate into their cytosols. Nitrate then crosses the endodermis of the root and is released into the xylem. After long distance transport up the xylem, nitrate is again actively transported into the cells of the leaf. Once in the cell, nitrate can be stored in the vacuole (due to toxicity) or reduced to nitrite by the enzyme nitrate reductase (NR).
/
/Four classes of nitrate reductases are known - a eukaryotic class, and three prokaryotic classes. The eukaryotic nitrate reductases are found in plants, algae and fungi, and are involved in assimilation of nitrate. They are composed of two identical subunits, and contain a |FRAME: CPD-8123| and an |FRAME:FAD| prosthetic group. In general, plant enzymes prefer NADH as the electron donor (|FRAME: NITRATE-REDUCTASE-NADH-RXN "E.C. 1.7.1.1"|) and fungal enzymes prefer NADPH (|FRAME: NITRATE-REDUCTASE-NADPH-RXN "E.C. 1.7.1.3"|), although some enzymes were reported
/to accept either of these compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE-REDUCTASE-NADPORNOPH-RXN "E.C. 1.7.1.2"|) |CITS: [14209328]|.
/Example for eukaryotic enzymes include the |FRAME: CPLX-7198| from |FRAME: TAX-3702| and the
/|FRAME: CPLX-7498| from |FRAME: TAX-5141|. 
/
/Nitrite is transported into the chloroplast, where it is reduced to ammonia by nitrite reductase (NiR). The final step of the pathway is the incorporation of ammonia into glutamine by glutamine synthetase |CITS: [ARABIDOPSIS94]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Most organisms have to deal with the excretion of nitrogen waste originating from protein and amino acid catabolism. In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia (ammonotelism), while land-dwelling organisms developed ways to convert the toxic ammonia to either urea (ureotelism) or uric acid (uricotelism). Generally, birds and saurian reptiles excrete uric acid, while the remaining species, including mammals, excrete urea |CITS:[13672961][13672962]|. Remarkably, tadpoles excrete ammonia, and shift to urea production during metamorphosis
/|CITS:[13672962]|.
/
/The urea is formed in the livers of mammals in a cyclic pathway which was initially named the Krebs-Henseleit cycle after its discoverers, and later became known simply as the urea cycle. This cycle was partially deduced by Krebs and Henseleit in 1932 |CITS: [Krebs32]| and was clarified in the 1940s as the roles of citrulline and argininosuccinate as intermediates were understood |CITS:[3545062]|.
/
/In this cycle, amino groups donated by |FRAME:AMMONIA| and |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE| are converted to |FRAME:UREA|, while |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, |FRAME:L-CITRULLINE|, |FRAME:L-ARGININO-SUCCINATE|, and |FRAME:ARG| act as intermediates.
/
/Despite the generalization above, the pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds |CITS:[4217066]|, invertebrates |CITS:[14465664][5869779]|, insects |CITS: [697760][5791517]|, plants |CITS: [13741005] [13958361]|, yeast |CITS:[11946245]|, fungi |CITS:[4996649]|, and even microorganisms |CITS:[5593971][5709377]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-183 Gallate| is an essential precursor for many plant secondary metabolites, particularly |FRAME: HYDROLYZED-TANNIN "hydrolyzable tannins| such as gallo- and ellagitannins |CITS: [11423141]|. Both plants and fungi produce high concentrations of gallate |CITS: [9325260]|, while bacteria are known to produce small amounts.
/
/An early intermediate of the shikimate pathway, |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE|, has been implicated as a potential precursor for gallate synthesis in plants |CITS: [15474568]|. A careful study has revealed that gallate is formed from |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE| by the action of |FRAME: AT3G06350-MONOMER|, a multifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes the reversible reduction of |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE| to |FRAME: SHIKIMATE| |CITS: [Muir11]|. In the presence of NADPH the enzyme catalyzes reduction of |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE|, and in the presence of NADP+ it catalyzes its oxidation to |FRAME: CPD-13085|, an unstable compound that undergoes a spontaeous and rapid rearrangement to |FRAME: CPD-183|.
/
/This observation has been confirmed by several methods. Overexpression of cloned shikimate dehydrogenase from |FRAME: TAX-51240| in |FRAME: TAX-4097| resulted in increase of over 500% in the accumulation of gallate. In addition, shikimate dehydrogenase enzymes that were purified from several plants, as well as the bacterium |FRAME:TAX-562|, were shown to produce gallate <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [Muir11]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Fatty acids are often found in the cell in the activated form of an acyl-coA. Acyl-CoAs are used in the biosynthesis of many cellular products and components. In plants they are involved in the biosynthesis of membrane lipids, seed storage lipids, |FRAME: Wax-Esters wax|, |FRAME: Cutins cutins| and |FRAME: Suberins suberin|.
/
/Intracellular membranes are generally barriers for acyl-CoAs, preventing their movement within the cell. To circumvent this limitation, fatty acids are transported in their free form, and converted to acyl-CoAs while crossing the membrane by the enzymes acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS). These enzymes catalyze the esterification of fatty acids into the CoA thioesters concomitant with transport. In plant cells, ACS activity has been detected in plastids, oil bodies, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the ER.
/
/The activated fatty-CoAs can be hydrolyzed back to free acids (see |FRAME: PWY-5148|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The three aromatic amino acids, |FRAME: TRP|, |FRAME: TYR|, and |FRAME: PHE|, derived from the common precursor 
/|FRAME: CHORISMATE|, are constituents of proteins, and precursors of many plant secondary metabolites.
/ 
/Two steps are required for conversion of |FRAME: PREPHENATE| to |FRAME: TYR|: a dehydrogenation/decarboxylation
/and a transamination.
/Two possible routes for this conversion are known. In the route described in |FRAME: TYRSYN| the
/decarboxylation occurs first, resulting in the intermediate |FRAME: P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE|, followed by
/a transamination to |FRAME: TYR|. In the second route, described here, transamination occurs first, resulting in formation of
/|FRAME: CPD-659|, which is subsequently decarboxylated to |FRAME: TYR|.
/
/While the first route has been confirmed in many microorganisms, including E.coli  and yeast, 
/some other bacteria, including cyanobacteria, as well as many plants, employ the arogenate route |CITS: [4206476][3298985]|.
/The two routes  have been reported to co-exist in many microorganisms. In addition, the
/|FRAME: P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE| route cannot be completely ruled out for plants based on these facts: 
/
/1) early studies detected prephenate dehydrogenase activity in mung bean shoots |CITS: [4379953]|,
/
/2) the Arabidopsis arogenate dehydrogenase TyrAAT2 presents a weak prephenate dehydrogenase 
/activity |CITS: [12354106]|, even though the high Km for prephenate and low specific activity of prephenate 
/dehydrogenase reaction indicates the reaction is unlikely physiologically significant.
/
/Two types of arogenate dehydrogenase are known, that utilze either NADP+ or NAD+. These two types
/are described by the pathways |FRAME: PWY-3461| and |FRAME: PWY-6120|, respectively.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The two key reactions in this pathway are catalyzed by the enzymes |FRAME: MONOMER-8101| and
/|FRAME: AT5G34930-MONOMER|, respectively.
/
/Arogenate is the branch-point and the immediate precursor for the synthesis of both tyrosine and phenylalanine. 
/Arogenate dehydrogenase is the key enzyme channeling arogenate towards tyrosine synthesis. Its activity is 
/strongly feedback inhibited by tyrosine. 
/
/The Arabidopsis |FRAME: AT5G34930-MONOMER| |CITS:[12354106]|, as well as the enzyme from the cyanobacterium
/|FRAME: TAX-1148| |CITS: [15171683]|, are strictly NADP-dependent (see |FRAME: PWY-3461|).
/The enzymes from maize |CITS:[Byng1981]| and the actinobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1866|
/|CITS:[2590341]| are strictly NAD-dependent.

The former acts as electron transfer cofactor (known as A1) of photosystem I (PS I) in higher plants and cyanobacteria. It is very similar to |FRAME: Menaquinones| (vitamin K2), a naphthoquinone which is common in non-photosynthetic microbes, in which it serves in anaerobic electron transport systems |CITS:[8626063]|. The only difference between phyloquinone and menaquinone is in the polyprenyl tail. Menaquinones contain 1-14 isoprene units, while phyloquinone contains a phytyl side chain of 4 units |CITS: [15686525]|.
/
/|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE Phylloquinone| was given the name vitamin K by Dam in 1935
/|CITS: [Dam35]| and was first isolated in 1939 from alfalfa |CITS: [805522]|.
/
/It has been found that phylloquinone is not absolutely required for efficient electron transfer in PS I
/|CITS: [10722690]|. In |FRAME:TAX-1148| benzoquinones such as plastoquinone-9, which usually act as secondary electron acceptors in PS II |CITS: [11470786][15681848]|, can efficiently replace phylloquinone in the A1-site of PS I as a one-electron cofactor. However, as shown in an |FRAME:TAX-3701| mutant the deficiency of phylloquinone causes distortions in the thylakoid structure of chloroplasts, may abolish PS I, and affects the functionality of PS II |CITS: [15686525]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of phylloquinone was studied in detail in the cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1148| and the genes encoding enzymes of this pathway were identified by comparison with genes encoding enzymes of the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway in |FRAME:TAX-562| (see |FRAME: PWY-5838|) |CITS: [8626063]|. With the isolation and functional confirmation of the homolog genes in |FRAME:TAX-1142| encoding for phytyl transferase, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate
/synthase |CITS: [10722690]|, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase |CITS: [11772039]|, SHCHC synthase
/and o-succinylbenzoic acid-CoA synthase |CITS: [JOHNSON03]| most of the enzymatic steps of the phylloquinone bisoynthesis have been determined and proven to be highly identical with those in the menaquinone biosynthesis.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzymatic steps involved in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and plants are similar to the biosynthetic route leading to the microbial complement menaquinone.
/
/The discernible step between phylloquinone and menaquinone biosynthesi is the prenylation step. |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.130| catalyzes the attachment of a C-20 phytyl side chain leading to |FRAME:CPD-6947| |CITS: [15686525]|, whereas microbial DHNA prenyltransferases attache a multiprenyl side chain, forming demethylmenaquinones. 
/
/It has been demonstrated that the final step of the pathway, a transmethylation reaction to form |FRAME:CPD-12831|, depends on the oxidation state of the penultimate substrate. Only this reduced (quinol) substrate is able to accept the electrons from the electrophilic |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| for the transmethylation. This led to the discovery that one more reaction was inserted in between |FRAME:CPD-6947| and the final product |FRAME:CPD-12831|. This reaction is catalyzed by type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in both <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>  sp. PCC 6803 encoded by NDC1 and ndbB, respectively (now classified as |FRAME: EC-1.6.5.12|). Mutants lacking this enzyme accumulate |FRAME: CPD-6947| |CITS:[26023160]|. 
/
/This indicates that the pathway intermediates prior to this step are in the quinone form, since they require reduction by |FRAME: EC-1.6.5.12|. Thus |FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE|, or an earlier intermediate, must be oxidized to a qunone form such as |FRAME: CPD-18334| by an unknown process prior to the phytyl chain attachment.
/
/In general, the intermediates of the |FRAME:PWY-5027| including in-feeding pathways such as |FRAME:PWY-5837| are depicted in their dihydroxy conformation, for example see |FRAME:DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| and |FRAME:CPD-9925|, although the latter has been shown to be used <i>in vitro</i> in its diketo form |CITS:[19321747]|. However, the study on the dehydrogenases of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Synechocystis</i> provide evidence that |FRAME:CPD-6947| and probably any other preceding intermediates occur in their diketo instead of the dihydroxy form |CITS:[Basset15]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well  documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "EC 2.4.2.9"|), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step. The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants |CITS: [16660311][216696][2189783][8856065][11773618][14658380]|. This pathway was shown to be the major route for uracil salvage in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.
/
/Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).
/
/Some archaea, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7932| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 "EC 3.5.4.1"|) are also able to salvage exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by converting it to |FRAME: URACIL| (see |FRAME: PWY-7194|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE "1,2-Diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate"|, often referred to as phosphatidate (PA), is a class of compounds consisting of a |FRAME: GLYCEROL| backbone, a (usually) saturated fatty acid bonded to carbon 1, a (usually) unsaturated fatty acid bonded to carbon 2, and a phosphate group esterified to carbon 3.
/
/PA is an intermediate in structural lipid biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY| and |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY|), and an important second messenger. In plants, PA is rapidly and transiently generated in response to a number of biotic (pathogens) and abiotic (such as cold and salt stress) stimulates (reviewed in |CITS: [16023886]|). Using a so-called differential labeling method, it was shown that there are two pathways, the phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase pathway (PLC pathway), and the phospholipase D pathway (PLD pathway), that generate PA as a signaling molecule in response to environmental signals (reviewed in |CITS: [19394438]|). In the PLC pathway, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, derived from phosphatidylinositol, is converted to diacylglycerol which is rapidly phosphorylated to PA. In the PLD pathway, PA is directly formed from structural lipid phosphatidylcholine. The two pathways are differentially activated in response to different stimulates |CITS: [16023886]|. Once formed, PA can be further converted to diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) by PA kinase (reviewed in |CITS: [16469533]|). This is a possible mechanism in PA attenuation. Interestingly, mammals do not seem to have PA kinase activity.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The pathway of |FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis from |FRAME: THR| is a five-step pathway
/that shares its last four steps with the pathway of |FRAME: VAL| biosynthesis. These
/entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates
/not only |FRAME: ILE| and |FRAME: VAL|, but also |FRAME: LEU|.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
/of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
/to regulation by all three amino acids. The first enzyme in the pathway,
/|FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|, is downregulated by isoleucine and leucine, but is upregulated by
/valine. The following pathway step, catalyzed by |FRAME: ACETOLACTSYNI-CPLX| (AHAS I) and
/|FRAME: ACETOLACTSYNIII-CPLX| (AHAS III), is inhibited by all three amino acids. This apparent
/paradox of valine stimulation of step one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the
/preference of AHAS III for processing of the isoleucine precursor |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| rather
/than the valine precursor |FRAME: PYRUVATE|. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS
/enzymes are inhibited, blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well.
/However, the stimulation of |FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX| generates a substantial pool of
/|FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for this compound, this allows
/the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.
/
/Enteric bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-511145| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| have been shown to possess two types
/of threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine (see
/|FRAME: THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX|), and a consistitutively-produced biosynthetic enzyme
/(|FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|. Both enzymes convert threonine to
/|FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, but differ in their regulation and expression.
/
/Biosynthetic threonine dehydratases were also described in several soil bacteria |CITS: [16743051]|.
/A survey of 75 soil isolates capable of growth on L-threonine revealed a group of three organisms
/that possessed substantial L-threonine dehydratase activity, to the exclusion of any other
/threonine-catabolyzing enzyme |CITS: [5076220]|.  The group consisted of |FRAME:ORG-5895| and two
/|FRAME:TAX-1696| isolates. The enzyme from |FRAME:ORG-5895| was partially purified, and was
/found to be of the biosynthetic type on the criteria that its formation was consitutive, it was susceptible
/to inhibition by |FRAME:ILE|, |FRAME:VAL| protected against denaturation and was a positive effector
/and antagonist of isoleucine, and neither AMP nor ADP acted as effectors |CITS: [16743051]|.
/Interestingly, even though the enzyme was of the biosynthetic type, the researchers found that
/much of the threonine in these organisms was converted to |FRAME:PROPIONATE| in a catabolic
/pathway identical to that described in |FRAME:PWY-5437|. Thus, the biosynthetic enzyme was recruited
/to a catabolic pathway.
/
/A biosynthetic threonine dehydratase was also reported in |FRAME:TAX-615| |CITS: [355220]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The plastid envelope, like the thylakoid membrane, is predominated by glycolipids. The only phospholipid found in chloroplast thylakoids is |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL "phosphatidylglycerol"|, which is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the thylakoid membranes.
/
/The acyl donors for the two acyltransferase reactions leading to the formation of |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE|, the precursor of phosphatidylglycerol, can be either an acyl-ACP or an acyl-CoA, depending on the location of the pathway. In plants the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol can occur at three subcellular locations - chloroplast, mitochondrion and ER. In the plastid phosphatidylglycerol is assembled <i>de novo</i> from the newly synthesized fatty acids, and acyl-ACPs are the acyl donors |CITS: [16774646]|.
/In the non-plastidic pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-8|) acyl-CoA are used as the acyl-donor |CITS: [Moore82]|.
/
/In Arabidopsis, this pathway accounts for about 85% of phosphatidylglycerol in the plastid.

/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine nucleotides can be catabolized through three different pathways. The best characterized is the reductive pathway (this pathway and |FRAME: PWY-6430|) in which the pyrimidine nucleotides are reduced to |FRAME:Beta-amino-acids|, |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|. The pathway is found in mammals, plants, some fungi and microorganisms |CITS:[13428755][13416173][16655478][16656066][10656811]|. The oxidative pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6426|) is only found in a few bacterial species and has not been characterized nearly as well. In it uracil is converted to |FRAME: UREA| and |FRAME: MALONATE| via |FRAME: BARBITURATE| |CITS: [12981104][14955523]|. A third pathway, known as the Rut pathway, was discovered much later in |FRAME: TAX-562| and other bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY0-1471|) |CITS: [16540542]|. That pathway starts by ring opening of the pyrimidine nucleotide, and forms |FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-PROPIONATE| from uracil, with concomitant production of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway is found in mammals, plants, some fungi and microorganisms. It has been observed in various microorganisms including |FRAME: ORG-6124| |CITS: [13416173][13416174]|, |FRAME: TAX-12917| |CITS: [4986615]|, |FRAME: TAX-37762| |CITS: [3553866]|, |FRAME: TAX-287| |CITS: [1903745]|, |FRAME: TAX-329| |CITS: [ 7710277]|, |FRAME: TAX-316| |CITS: [Xu92]|, |FRAME: TAX-303| |CITS: [11759049]|, |FRAME: TAX-292| |CITS: [West97]|, |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [3926948]| and |FRAME: TAX-51101| |CITS: [12670488]|, as well as the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4934| |CITS: [10656811]|.
/
/The pathway also operates in mammalian tissues |CITS: [12981074][13428755]|. The product of the pathway, |FRAME: B-ALANINE|, is a central component of |FRAME:PANTOTHENATE| and |FRAME:GAMMA-BUTYROBETAINE| biosynthesis, and in mammals also functions as a neurotransmitter |CITS: [6117607]| and as a precursor for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARNOSINE| and |FRAME: CPD-401| |CITS: [3108250]|. While in bacteria |FRAME: B-ALANINE| biosynthesis usually occurs through the decarboxylation of |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5155|), it is generally thought that the pyrimidine degradation pathway is the main route for the synthesis of |FRAME: B-ALANINE| in mammals |CITS: [14705962]|.
/
/Radiotracer experiments in germinating grains of |FRAME: TAX-4565| |CITS: [mazus72]|, whole plants of |FRAME: TAX-227291| |CITS: [duhaze03]| and potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]| showed that uracil is efficiently converted to |FRAME: B-ALANINE|. Mutant analyses in |FRAME: ORG-5993| further support the existence of this pathway and indicate that it might be important for helping plants to reallocate nitrogen from pyrimidines into general nitrogen metabolism |CITS: [19413687]|
/
/The pathway proceeds in three sequential enzymatic steps. The first enzyme is |FRAME: MONOMER-15398| (EC 1.3.1.2), which catalyzes the reversible reduction of both |FRAME:URACIL| and |FRAME: THYMINE| to |FRAME: DI-H-URACIL| and |FRAME: DIHYDRO-THYMINE|, respectively (see also the |FRAME: PWY-6430| pathway). The second enzyme, |FRAME: MONOMER-15399| (EC 3.5.2.2) performs reversible hydrolytic ring-opening of |FRAME: DI-H-URACIL| and |FRAME: DIHYDRO-THYMINE| to |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-ISOBUTYRATE|, respectively. Finally, |FRAME: MONOMER-15400| (EC 3.5.1.6) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-ISOBUTYRATE| to |FRAME: B-ALANINE| and |FRAME: 3-AMINO-ISOBUTYRATE|, respectively, in a reaction that produces ammonium and carbon dioxide.
/
/This pathway has special importance in humans, since it is responsible for the degradation of |FRAME: CPD0-1327|, an important anticancer drug. Patients with defects in the enzymes of this pathway show adverse response to treatment with this drug, including death |CITS: [993199]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The citrulline degradation pathway is widely distributed among prokaryotic organisms, often associated with the degradation of arginine into citrulline (see |FRAME: ARGDEGRAD-PWY|), it has been detected in lactic bacteria |CITS: [10359490][10733246][15939575]|, bacilli |CITS: [4436643][690081]|, |FRAME:TAX-286| spp. |CITS: [6438064][3129535]|, |FRAME:TAX-642| spp. |CITS: [6303241]|, clostridia |CITS: [12999794][5335895]|, |FRAME:TAX-2093| spp. |CITS: [5911610][126306][6438064][3806049]|, streptococci |CITS: [2843090]|, |FRAME:TAX-2132| spp. |CITS: [Igwebe78]|, <i>Spirochaeta</i> spp. |CITS: [977548]|, halobacteria |CITS: [5903088]|, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [100070]|.
/
/In addition, the pathway is also present in some primitive eukaryotic protozoans, including |FRAME: TAX-5722| |CITS: [6312311]|, |FRAME: TAX-56690| |CITS: [7866382]|, |FRAME: TAX-28002| |CITS: [12706792]|, and |FRAME: TAX-5741|, in which it plays a significant role in energy metabolism, providing a route for anaerobic substrate level phosphorylation |CITS: [2228433]|. 
/
/The enzymes of this pathway, as well as arginine deiminase, have also been found in |FRAME: ORG-5993|, and it was
/shown that |FRAME:TAX-3701| chloroplasts can metabolize arginine and citrulline all the way to CO<sub>2</sub>.
/However, since |FRAME:TAX-3701| rarely encounters exogenous citrulline, it is thought that in this organism the pathway may serve as a means for extracting nitrogen from endogenous sources |CITS: [8278506]|. The ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) has been identified from a T-DNA-tagged mutant of |FRAME:TAX-3701| and has been shown to be encoded by a gene that overlaps with another, unrelated gene (AUL1), one of the rare cases of gene convergence observed in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [10561504]|. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase has also been cloned from other plant sources such as |FRAME:TAX-3888| |CITS: [8914525]| and |FRAME:TAX-28957| |CITS: [10987149]| |CITS: [11575720]|.
/
/Bacteria that employ this pathway use the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase to convert |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| to |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|. The later is then broken into |FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an ATP-forming reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamate kinase, providing the bacteria with energy, carbon and nitrogen.
/
/While this pathway is a subset of the arginine deiminase pathway, some of the organisms that employ it lack the enzyme arginine deiminase (for example, |FRAME: TAX-1247| |CITS: [15939575]|), and thus are not able to utilize arginine, making this a distinct pathway.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an important antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor. Higher plants and higher animals (but not humans) can synthesize ascorbate. Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative ascorbate biosynthesis routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis <i>in vivo</i> have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-882|) that requires the enzymes PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure to detect PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|) |CITS:[12954627]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate contents observed in a PMI silenced line of tobacco, the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|).
/
/Another controversy concerns the enzymes VTC2/VTC5 (named for Vitamin C defficiency). Two activities of VTC2 have been reported, GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase and GDP-L-galactose: hexose-1-P guanylyltransferase. One study suggested that the major activity of VTC2 is the guanylyltransferase activity |CITS:[17485667]|, whereas another study suggested that phosphorylase is the major activity of VTC2 |CITS:[17462988]|. The guanylyltransferase activity is critical for the so called |FRAME: PWY4FS-12| and |FRAME: PWY4FS-13|, both of which lead to the formation of L-galactose-1-P, an intermediate in the L-galactose pathway. Arabidopsis double mutants of VTC2/VTC5 are seedling lethal, which can be rescued by supplementation with L-galactose |CITS:[17877701]|. It demonstrates that the L-galactose pathway is a critical source of ascorbate, at least in Arabidopsis.  
/
/The extended VTC2 cycle includes an additional (unidentified) enzyme in comparison with the VTC2 cycle. The putative GDP-D-mannose 2"-epimerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of GDP-D-glucose to GDP-D-mannose. GDP-D-glucose, that can be formed by VTC2, strongly inhibits GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase, another enzyme in the VTC2 cycle. Thus, the conversion of the "toxic" GDP-D-glucose by the extended VTC2 cycle makes the extended pathway more favorable than the original VTC2 cycle (reviewed in |CITS:[17950389]|). In addition, the extended VTC2 cycle can make direct use of D-glucose-1-P which is derived from photosynthesis.   
/
/The intermediate GDP-sugars in ascorbate biosynthesis are also substrates for cell wall polysaccharides biosynthesis and protein glycosylation.

UNIQUE-ID - PWY-762
TYPES - Phospholipid-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - phospholipid desaturation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698179965:bxue
COMMENT - Fatty acids constitute a major component of plant membranes in the form of glycerolipids, mainly phosphoglycerolipids and glycosylglycerolipids. The majority of them have C16 or C18 carbon chains and are attached to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. In Arabidopsis, the major fatty acids are C16:0, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. Unsaturated fatty acids are significant to membrane functions such as photosynthesis and cold tolerance. C16:3 and C18:3 together make up more than 90% of the fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a 
/major glycosylglycerolipid of leaf chloroplast membranes |CITS: [arabidopsis94]|.   
/
/C18:1 is desaturated from C18:0 in the form of stearoyl-ACP (|FRAME: PWY-5147|) and is subsequently incorporated into glycerolipids. The rest of the unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:2 and C18:3, on the other hand, are desaturated from C16:0 or C18:1 after C16:0 and C18:1 are incorporated into glycerolipids. These latter desaturation processes are catalyzed by membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases, and occur in chloroplasts and ER. Fatty acid desaturation is best studied in Arabidopsis using desaturase mutants. 
/
/The desaturation of phosphatidylglycerol occurs in the chloroplast, and the desaturation of phosphatidylcholine occurs in the ER. Note that desaturation occurs on both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, and that the order of the desaturation steps on one chain versus the other is not known. Here, all the possible steps are presented.

/When SAM donates its methyl group, it is converted to |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|. This molecule can be
/recycled back to SAM via the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle, also known as the activated methyl cycle (AMC).
/
/There are two main variations of this pathway, one found mostly in prokaryotes, while the other is found predominantly, but not exclusively, in eukaryotes (for example, it operates in |FRAME: TAX-1773| |CITS: [18815415]|. The main difference between the variants is the processing of |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| (SAH), the immediate product of the methylation reactions.
/
/In the first pathway (described in |FRAME: PWY-6151|) SAH is first hydrolyzed to |FRAME: CPD-564| by the |FRAME: MONOMER-1290|, followed by conversion to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| by |FRAME: CPLX-7753|. 
/In the second pathway, which is described in |FRAME: PWY-5041|, SAH is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| in a single step, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-5161|.
/
/The cycle continues with the methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| using a methyl group
/from a methylated folate. In some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-9606|, this reaction is catalyzed by a
/|FRAME: HOMOCYSMETB12-MONOMER| (EC 2.1.1.13). In other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|,
/the reaction is catalyzed by a |FRAME: G18NG-10711-MONOMER| (EC 2.1.1.14). Yet some organisms,
/such as |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1718|, have both enzymes, as described in the pathway
/|FRAME: HSERMETANA-PWY|. In |FRAME: TAX-562| the reaction catalyzed by the B12-dependent enzyme is more
/than 100-fold faster than the reaction catalyzed by the B12-independent isoenzyme |CITS: [15215334]|.
/
/Finally, the cycle is completed with the regeneration of SAM by |FRAME: CPLX-7754|.
/
/About |FRAME: CPLX-5161|: While the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is reversible, the equilibrium favors
/the synthesis of |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|. Thus the removal of the hydrolysis product
/|FRAME: HOMO-CYS| is critical for the continuous operation of the cycle.
/This is achieved by the efficient conversion of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| via
/|FRAME: AT5G17920-MONOMER|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Chlorophylls Chlorophyll| is a green photosynthetic pigment found in photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria. Its name is derived from ancient Greek: <i>chloros</i> = green and <i>phyllon</i> = leaf. Chlorophyll absorbs mostly in the blue and, to a lesser extent, red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence its intense green color. There are several variants of chlorophyll (|FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|, |FRAME: CPD-10334|, |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B|, |FRAME: CPD-10336|, |FRAME: CPD-10337|, and |FRAME: CPD-10335|). Non-oxygenic bacteria possess a related pigment called bacteriochlorophyll, which also exists in several variants (|FRAME:CPD-9067|, |FRAME:CPD-9091|,
/|FRAME:CPD-9092|,  |FRAME:CPD-9093|,  |FRAME:CPD-9094| and  |FRAME:CPD-9095|). This pathway describes the formation of |FRAME: DIVINYL-PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|, an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of all chlorophylls.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthetic pathway of chlorophylls begins with the condensation of eight molecules of |FRAME:5-AMINO-LEVULINATE| (ALA, originating from |FRAME: GLT|) to |FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, the first cyclic tetrapyrrole (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|). This compound is then sequentially converted to |FRAME:PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|, which is the branch-point intermediate to hemes and chlorophylls.
/
/The incorporation of |FRAME: MG+2| into |FRAME:PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| occurs at the next step, resulting in the formation of |FRAME:MG-PROTOPORPHYRIN| (MgP). A methyl transferase subsequently converts MgP into
/|FRAME:MG-PROTOPORPHYRIN-MONOMETHYL-ESTER| (MgPMME), which is the substrate for a cyclase reaction, involving molecular oxygen. The cyclase forms |FRAME:DIVINYL-PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|, an intermediate that contains a fifth ring (ring E), characteristic of all chlorophylls. A combined action by an 8-vinyl reductase (multiple forms exist) and a protochlorophyllide reductase (multiple forms exist) results in the formation of |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|.
/
/This pathway describes the action of It should be noted that most organisms also possess a light-independent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A| from |FRAME: MONO-VINYL-PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|. That enzyme is described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7159|.
/
/This biosynthetic pathway, which occurs in all aerobic photosynthetic organisms, has been described through genetic analysis of bacterial mutants and <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution of individual reactions |CITS:[9442890][12242396][beale99][14617630]|.
/
/Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria possess a very similar pathway. However, the cyclase found in these organisms does not require molecular oxygen. A variant of the pathway found in anaerobic bacteria is described in |FRAME:PWY-5531|.

/the central energy metabolism molecule oxaloacetate into threonine.
/
/This pathway is regulated at multiple points by its end product, both via enzyme inhibition and attenuation.
/Attenuation in response to isoleucine and threonine represses the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth steps in
/this pathway. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ThrA is inhibited by threonine, regulating flux
/through the second and fourth steps in the pathway.
/
/The presence of three enzymes carrying out the second step and two enzymes carrying out the fourth
/step in the threonine biosynthesis pathway reflects the many downstream products that depend on those
/reaction steps. Look at the |FRAME: P4-PWY| for a full explanation of the overarching regulatory relationships

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-535 "Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate"| is a potent allosteric regulator with dual simultaneous functions. It is an activator of |FRAME: HS06881-MONOMER "phosphofructokinase"| and an inhibitor of |FRAME: CPLX66-505 "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"|, the key rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively |CITS: [1657152][8393580][7574501]|. In plants |FRAME: CPD-535| is a key regulator of primary carbohydrate metabolism in photosynthetic tissues |CITS: [10899575]|.
/
/An increased concentration of intracellular |FRAME: CPD-535| increases glycolytic flux, while at low concentrations of the metabolite, there is a net increase in gluconeogenic flux |CITS: [12379646]|. The metabolic role of |FRAME: CPD-535| has great potential for therapeutic intervention in type II diabetes |CITS: [11165514]|.
/
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/Mammals and plants have bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFK/FBPases) that catalyze both the synthesis and degradation of |FRAME: CPD-535| due to two independent catalytic domains in a single polypeptide chain. The kinase domain is localized within the amino-terminal part of the enzyme, and the bisphosphatase domain is in the carboxy-terminal region |CITS: [16839880]|.|FRAME: HS01277-MONOMER "TIGAR"|, a novel p53-inducible protein, only catalyzes the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: CPD-535|. In fungi two different enzymes catalyze the two functions.
/
/It has been suggested that the primary role of the enzyme is protection against oxidative stress |CITS: [16839880]|. It increases flux through gluconeogenesis, which increases the isomerization of |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate|. The latter metabolite is diverted into the |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY| resulting in the generation of |FRAME: NADPH| required for |FRAME: PWY-4081| and |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY| and production of |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, an important anti-oxidant.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: PRO| can be catabolized to |FRAME: GLT| by the action of two enzymatic activities: |FRAME: EC-1.5.99.8| (PDH) (sometimes referred to as proline oxidase) and |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.88| (previously known as &Delta;-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, or P5CDH).
/
/Whereas in eukaryotes PDH and P5CDH are encoded by two different genes, in most bacteria, including enteric bacteria
/|CITS: [6270100][6270101]|, |FRAME: TAX-1061| |CITS: [7592417]|, |FRAME: TAX-375| |CITS: [8572700]|, |FRAME: TAX-658| |CITS: [8645272]|, |FRAME: TAX-358| |CITS: [8971722]|, and |FRAME: ORG-6005| |CITS: [10715000]|, both steps are catalyzed by a single polypeptide encoded by the <i>putA</i> gene. The enzyme is highly conserved among different microorganisms, but its genetic organization and control of expression are highly divergent |CITS: [10715000]|.
/
/|FRAME:TAX-4932| is able to utilize proline as a sole nitrogen source. |FRAME: PRO| is catabolized within the mitochondrial matrix. Since both enzymes are encoded in the nucleus and synthesized in the cytoplasm, they are imported into the mitochondria before they become active |CITS:  [387737] [6358862]|.
/
/|FRAME: PRO| can serve as a total source of carbon and energy or of nitrogen for |FRAME:TAX-562|.  In the two steps (both of which are catalyzed by a product of <i>putA</i>) shown here, proline is converted to |FRAME: GLT|, which is further degraded to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, an intermediate of the |FRAME: TCA|.  Curiously, |FRAME: GLT|, the product of |FRAME: PRO| degradation, cannot itself serve as a total source of carbon and energy for |FRAME:TAX-562| because |FRAME: GLT| transport supplies exogenous |FRAME: GLT| at an inadequate rate. 
/
/The pathway is shown here in three steps because |FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE| is an intermediate between |FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE| and |FRAME: GLT|. The hydrolysis of |FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE| occurs spontaneously.
/
/In addition to serving as a building block of proteins, |FRAME: PRO| acts as an osmotic protectant.  Consistent with this role, high osmolarity inhibits |FRAME: PRO| degradation.

Those are called essential fatty acids, and are classified as either &omega;3 or &omega;6 fatty acids, depending on the distance of the last double bond from the end of the molecule.
/
/PUFAs are not commonly found in higher plants, which typically produce saturated and mono-unsaturated long chain fatty acids as common constituents of their lipids. They are produced by many algae, lower ukaryotes, mosses and ferns, where they are found in all major glycerol lipids and represent major constituents of membranes |CITS: [16728405]|. They are also produced by some marine bacteria that are adapted to cold temperatures and high pressure.
/
/|FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID "Arachidonate"| (arachidonic acid) is a polyunsaturated &omega;-6 fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain and four <i>cis</i>-double bonds. It is produced <i>de novo</i> at high levels by mosses, by some lower eukaryotes (e.g. Euglena), and by some marine bacteria adapted to low temperatures and high pressures.

/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/The most common |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| synthesis pathway is the |FRAME: PWY-6000 "6-desaturase/&Delta;6-elongase pathway"|, in which |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| is first desaturated by a 6-desaturase to yield |FRAME: CPD-8117|, followed by a &Delta;6-elongation to produce |FRAME: CPD-8120| and a |FRAME: PWY-7592 "second desaturation"| by a 5-desaturase to form |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID|  (see for example |FRAME: PWY-5353|). However, some of the organisms that produce |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| lack a 6-desaturase and utilize an alternative pathway that includes a &Delta;9 elongase and an 8-desaturase, as described in this pathway |CITS: [10328826]|.
/
/The &Delta;8 pathway has been described in the ciliated protozoan |FRAME: TAX-5908| |CITS: [5961271]|, in the soil amoebae |FRAME: TAX-5756| |CITS: [4309952]|, in euglenoid species |CITS: [14216427]| and in the microalga |FRAME: TAX-561169| |CITS: [17291553]|. Interestingly, it has also been described in rat and human testis (|CITS: [588579][459715]|, but not in healthy breast tissue or brain.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<B>General Background</B>
/
/The |FRAME: Galactolipids galactolipids| |FRAME: D-Galactosyl-12-diacyl-glycerols monogalactosyldiacylglycerol| (MGDG) and |FRAME: Galactosyl-galactosyl-diacyl-glycerols digalactosyldiacylglycerol| (DGDG) are prevalent membrane
/lipids in organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, such as land plants, algae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [Dormann01]|. MGDG and DGDG constitute about 50% and 30%, respectively, of the total lipids in the majority of photosynthetic membranes.
/
/Crystallographic analysis of photosystem complexes revealed that stoichiometric amounts of both types of galactolipids are bound in the interior of photosystem complexes |CITS: [16963124][21499260]|, and it has been shown that a galactolipid-deficient mutant of |FRAME: TAX-3702| lacks photosynthetic activity |CITS: [17940034]|.
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/The biosynthesis of galactolipids in plants is localized to the envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Thus both MGDG and DGDG have to be transported to the thylakoid membranes during chloroplast development.
/
/The glycosylglycerides are synthesized using |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL diacylglycerol| (DAG) as the starting compound. The first enzyme of galactolipid synthesis, |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.46|, was isolated from cucumber seedlings |CITS: [8990209]|. This enzyme transfers a galactose residue from |FRAME: CPD-14553| onto diacylglycerol. The enzyme inverts the anomeric configuration of the galactose, resulting in a &beta; bond to DAG. Three genes encoding MGDG synthases were isolated from Arabidopsis |CITS: [11553816]|. However, only |FRAME: AT4G31780| is crucial for the synthesis of most of the MGDG lipid required for thylakoid membrane assembly in chloroplasts. |FRAME: AT5G20410| and |FRAME: AT2G11810| are only expressed in certain plant organs or under specific conditions such as phosphate limitation |CITS: [18808455]|.
/
/The second enzyme involved is |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.241|. Arabidopsis contains two genes encoding the enzyme - |FRAME: AT3G11670| and |FRAME: AT4G00550| |CITS: [10381884]|. Both are UDP-galactose-dependent galactosyltransferases that transfer galactose from |FRAME: CPD-14553| onto MGDG with retention of the anomeric configuration of the sugar moiety.
/
/In addition to MGDG and DGDG, plants contain low amounts of oligogalactolipids with three or four galactose residues in their head groups. The synthesis of these oligogalactolipids is independent of DGDG synthases |FRAME: AT3G11670| and |FRAME: AT4G00550|, and is carried out by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.184| (GGGT) |CITS: [12743031]|, which is encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G06510| gene |CITS: [20798281]|. GGGT is not related to glycosyltransferases and belongs to the family of glycosylhydrolases. The enzyme acts on MGDG, converting it into di-, tri-, and tetragalactosyldiacylglycerol during low temperature stress. The galactosyl linkages are all in &beta; form |CITS: [12743031]|. The GGGT activity provides an important mechanism for the stabilization of the chloroplast membranes during freezing and drought stress. SFR2 is essential for the adaptation of Arabidopsis to freezing stress |CITS: [15258268][18466306]|

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The pathway of valine biosynthesis is a four-step pathway that shares all
/of its steps with the parallel pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis. These
/entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates
/not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
/of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
/to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily
/inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine.
/The potential disruption this might cause to the parallel
/isoleucine biosynthesis pathway step using the same enzymes is resolved by
/upregulation of an earlier step that is unique to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained
/in the |FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY| summary. In this way, valine biosynthesis can be regulated
/independently of isoleucine biosynthesis, despite all four valine biosynthesis enzymes
/also participating in isoleucine biosynthesis.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is a common compound found in all kingdoms of life.
/In some Gram-negative bacteria it is a precursor for synthesis of the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, a component of the outer membrane |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|), or of cell wall components such as |FRAME: CPD0-1099| (see |FRAME: COLANSYN-PWY|). In some Gram-positive bacteria it is involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide |CITS:[7929009]|.
/
/In plants a large amount of the cell-wall biomass is derived from |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| through the complex interconversion of nucleotide sugars (for review see |CITS:[15134748]|). |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is converted to a number of other sugars including |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE|, |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| and |FRAME: CPD-12513| (see |FRAME: PWY-5114|), which form diverse plant cell wall |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| polymers.
/
/In animals |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of |FRAME: ASCORBATE| by certain organsisms (see |FRAME: PWY3DJ-35471| and |FRAME: PWY-6415|). The other anomeric form, |FRAME: CPD-12521|, is found in |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycan| side chains of proteoglycan core proteins and polymers, such as |FRAME: Hyaluronan| and |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates|. It is also the substrate for liver glucuronosyltransferases that glucuronidate xenobiotics and some endogenous compounds in an important pathway for the metabolism of toxins and drugs. The resulting glucuronides are rapidly excreted through the biliary tract or kidneys (in |CITS: [9737970]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The most common route for formation of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is by the hydroxylation of |FRAME: CPD-12575|, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.22|. A second route has been observed in plants, starting with the polyol |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-4841|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Biotin-dependent carboxylases constitute a group of enzymes with many common features in structure
/and mechanism |CITS: [Wood77]|. These enzymes have been identified in prokaryotic and eukaryotic
/organisms. Some members of this family include |FRAME:CPLX-6282|, |FRAME:CPLX-5203|, |FRAME:MONOMER-9201| 
/and the |FRAME: TAX-1744| transcarboxylase |CITS: [8366018]|. These enzymes are involved in various metabolic reactions such as lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism.
/Another group of bioin-dependent enzymes are the decarboxylases mediating sodium transport |CITS: [2896195]| (for an example, see |FRAME: CPLX-7676| from |FRAME: TAX-57040|).
/
/The different biotin-dependent enzymes have different architectures in different organisms. For example, eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylases contain three functional modules in one large polypeptide (biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein/carboxyltransferase), eukaryotic propionyl-CoA-carboxylases and bifunctional acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylases of <i>Mycobacteria</i> are composed of a coupled biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein polypeptide and separate carboxyltransferase proteins, while all the subunits of |FRAME:TAX-562| acetyl-CoA carboxylase exist as single proteins |CITS: [8102604][7909542][8772169]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX| is one of the key enzymes in the
/biosynthesis of fatty acids (see |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|).
/The |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzyme complex is composed of two catalytic units and one carrier protein,
/encoded by four different genes.
/The catalytic units are |FRAME:BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX| (BC), a homodimer encoded by the
/|FRAME: EG10276| gene, and |FRAME:ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX| (ACCT), an
/&alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> tetramer, encoded by the |FRAME:EG11647| and
/|FRAME: EG10217| genes.
/The carrier protein is the |FRAME:BCCP-CPLX "biotin carboxyl carrier protein"| (BCCP), a homodimer encoded by the
/|FRAME:EG10275| gene.
/
/The BCCP monomer is biotinylated by the enzyme |FRAME:BIOTINLIG-ENZRXN|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
/|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
/In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In plants, the major site for fatty acid biosynthesis is plastids. However it is known that mitochondria of eukaryotes are also capable of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. For example, synthesis of fatty acyl-ACP from labeled malonate was detected in isolated mitochondria from pea |CITS: [10671542]|, and from Neurospora |CITS: [2137086]|.
/
/The plant mitochondrial pathway differs from the |FRAME: PWY-4381 "plastidic pathway"|. First, in the mitochondrial pathway, malonate, not acetyl-CoA, is the sole precursor of fatty acids, although the source of malonate is still poorly understood |CITS: [10671542]|. Second, malonyl-ACP serves as both the primer and donor substrates for de novo fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [14660674]|. Third, there is only one condensing enzyme involved in the mitochondrial pathway. In contrast to the three condensing enzymes in the plastids, KASIII, KASI and KASII, where each carry out the initial condensation, elongation from C4 to C16, and the elongation from C16 to C18 reactions, respectively, the mitochondrial condensing enzyme carries out both the priming and all the elongating reactions |CITS: [14660674]|. 
/
/The biological role of the mitochondrial pathway is not entirely clear. One role is to provide octanoyl-ACP for the |FRAME: PWY0-501 "biosynthesis of lipoate"|, an important sulfur-containing cofactor of a number of enzymes such as glycine decarboxylase complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase |CITS: [10671542]|. Another role is likely to provide fatty acyl chains for the |FRAME: PWY-5269 "synthesis of cardiolipin"|, a lipid unique to mitochondrial membranes |CITS: [Li-Beisson2010]|. 
/
/The pathway does not appear to operate in grasses (Poaceae) |CITS: [12972648]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: ILE| is one of the three main branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with |FRAME: LEU|
/and |FRAME:VAL|.
/The catabolic pathways of the BCAAs can be divided into two sequential series of reactions, referred to

/
/The common pathway includes the enzymes |FRAME: CPLX-6941|, |FRAME: CPLX-6940|, and
/|FRAME: CPLX-6942|. These three enzymes catalyze the conversion of all three BCAAs to their
/respective acyl-CoA derivatives
/(|FRAME:METHACRYLYL-COA|, |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, and |FRAME: CPD-1083|
/for |FRAME:VAL|, |FRAME:LEU|, and |FRAME:ILE|, respectively), though the intermediates formed
/by these enzymes are different for the different amino acids.
/The distal parts of the pathways are completely different for the three BCAAs, and comprise enzymes

/
/This Isoleucine degradation pathway is wide spread, and is found in many microorganisms, higher
/plants, and animals (including mammals).
/
/The catabolism of |FRAME: ILE| begins with its transamination to |FRAME:2-KETO-3-METHYL-VALERATE|,
/followed by oxidative decarboxylation to |FRAME:2-METHYL-BUTYRYL-COA|.

COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in this salvage pathway is uridine-cytidine kinase (also known as uridine kinase, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 "EC 2.7.1.48"|). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleosides |FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to their monophosphate forms.
/
/The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, although some differences exists among the enzymes. For example, the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-562| prefers GTP as the phosphate donor |CITS: [211379]|, while the mammalian enzyme prefers ATP. The enzymes from |FRAME: TAX-3702| are dual-domain proteins, with the second domain resembling |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "EC 2.4.2.9, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase"|, although they were shown to lack such activity |CITS: [19563437]|.
/
/Another enzyme that participates in the salvage of nucleosides is cytidine deaminase (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5 "EC 3.5.4.5"|). It has been shown in |FRAME: TAX-562| that exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is not directly converted to CMP. Instead, a very active |FRAME: CYTIDEAM-CPLX| converts it rapidly to |FRAME: URIDINE|, which is phosphorylated to UMP, and eventually converted to UTP and CTP. However, exogenously supplied cytidine will be phosphorylated to CMP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.
/
/This pathway was shown to be the exclusive pyrimidine ribonucleoside salvage pathway operating in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: D-Glucose| is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
/
/D-Glucose is also used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as |FRAME: CELLULOSE cellulose| and |FRAME: CELLULOSE chitin|. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of polymers such as |FRAME: Starch| and |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|.
/In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.
/
/The form of |FRAME: D-Glucose| used in biosynthesis is the activated sugar-nucleotide form, and usually the UDP-derived form |FRAME: CPD-12575|. This common activated form of glucose participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions in the cell, including the synthesis of many polysaccharaides (such as |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, |FRAME: Starch starch|, |FRAME: CPD-3602 laminarin| and |FRAME: CELLULOSE cellulose|), disaccharides (such as |FRAME: SUCROSE| and |FRAME: TREHALOSE|) and a very large number of &beta;-glucosides. It is also the starting molecule for the synthesis of many modified sugars that participate in the synthesis of surface polysaccharides such as the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigens| of Gram-negative bacteria and the S-layer of Gram-positive bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|).
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12575| can be converted by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-5.1.3.2| into |FRAME: CPD-14553|, which is a precursor for many polysaccharides on its own.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Plants accumulate and mobilize |FRAME: Starch| in both photosynthetic tissue (leaves) and non-photosynthetic storage tissues (such as tuber and seed endosperm). In leaves, starch is synthesized during the light period and is degraded during the dark period, as depicted in this pathway. In storage tissues, starch is degraded during tuber sprouting and seed germinating. Except for seed endosperm where starch degradation occurs in an acellular tissue (see |FRAME: PWY-842|), starch degradation generally occurs in the plastids (chloroplast of leaves and amyloplast of tubers) where starch accumulates. Isoforms of the starch degradation enzymes are also found and in many cases abundant in extra-plastidic subcellular locations in leaves and tubers. Their physiological functions are not well understood |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In leaves, starch biosynthesis leads to the formation of granules in the chloroplast stroma during the light period and the granules are degraded during the dark period. The starch granules have very complex structures. |FRAME: Starch Starch| is composed of two different polyglucan chains, |FRAME: CPD-7043 amylopectins| and |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses &alpha;-amyloses|. The |FRAME: CPD-7043 amylopectin| chains form double helices that are tightly packed in layers of crystalline lamellae. Starch degradation must proceed from the outside of these granules and requires the disruption of the tight association between amylopectin chains |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/Recent work has helped to reveal multiple enzymes that are involved in making the exterior polyglucan chains on the starch polymers more accessible to hydrolytic degradation. Notably, in Arabidopsis two enzymes, |FRAME: AT1G10760-MONOMER| (GWD) |CITS: [16914145][17666166]| and |FRAME: AT5G26570-MONOMER| (PWD) |CITS: [15686522][15618411]| sequentially catalyze the addition of phosphate to the C6 and then the C3 residues of glucosyl residues in the amylopectin chains to move them from an insoluble to a soluble state |CITS: [19325165][20192737]|. 
/The SEX4 |FRAME: AT3G52180-MONOMER| can help to make these soluble chains better substrates for the hydrolytic activity of &beta;-amylases by removing the phosphates residues |CITS: [20192737]|. 
/
/&beta;-amylases such as |FRAME: AT4G17090-MONOMER BAM3| remove maltose units from the &alpha;-1,4-linked unbranched chains of the amylopectin. Maltose is then transported out of the chloroplast for inclusion in various cytosolic sugar metabolism pathways |CITS: [14704427]|.
/
/As |FRAME: AT4G17090-MONOMER BAM3| and other chloroplastic &beta;-amylases release maltose from the exposed chains, they eventually encounter branch points introduced by &alpha;-1,6-linked glucosyl residues. Glucoses linked in this manner are not substrates for &beta;-amylases so these enzymes cannot act on the exposed chains again until a debranching enzyme, such as |FRAME: AT4G09020-MONOMER isoamylase 3| (ISA3) removes the &alpha;-1,6 linkages. Chloroplastic &beta;-amylases can then continue to release maltose units for export. Malto-oligosaccharide chains containing fewer than four glucosyl residues can be acted on by  |FRAME: AT5G64860-MONOMER DPE1|  or other chloroplastic disproportionating enzymes to release glucose. This glucose can also be transported to the cytosol for use in sugar metabolism |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/Though it is not depicted in this pathway, Chloroplastic &beta;-amylases enzymes also likey act on any &alpha;-1,4-linked-malto-oligosaccharide chains that are free in the stroma that contain at least four glucose residues |CITS: [20192737]|. 
/
/In some species, including |FRAME: TAX-3055| |CITS: [17018036]|and |FRAME: TAX-4530| (rice) |CITS: [18621947]|, the |FRAME: Linear-Malto-Oligosaccharides malto-oligosaccharides| may also be broken down to |FRAME: GLC-1-P| by malto-oligosaccharide phosphorylase enzymes (see |FRAME: RXN-12392 reaction|). Although a chloroplastic enzyme with this activity can be found in Arabidopsis (|FRAME: AT3G29320-MONOMER PHS1|), there is no evidence that it actually participates in starch degradation in that species |CITS: [15173560]|. In general, the potential <i>in planta</i> role of these enzymes in starch degradation remains a matter of on-going debate and investigation |CITS: [20192737]|.

CITATIONS - PMNIC2017:EV-IC
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/ L-Arabinose, the 4-epimer of D-xylose, is a monosaccharide found primarily in plants.  It is mainly present in cell wall polymers such as pectic (rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II) and hemicellulosic (xylan, xyloglucan) components, as well as in the glycosyl-moieties of proteins such as arabinogalactan proteins and extensions |CITS:[10517829],[10640355]|.  Although little is known of the incorporation of arabinose into these polymers or the contribution of the arabinosyl-substituents to the functions of the wall polymers, it has been demonstrated that arabinose-containing polymers are derived from UDP-L-arabinose, the activated sugar used by arabinosyltransferases |CITS:[FEINGOLD80]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>
/
/The formation of UDP-L-arabinose occurs via two routes: a) the <i>de novo</i> synthesis route (this pathway) involves the epimerisation of UDP-D-xylose by a UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase, and b) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-L-arabinose from free arabinose (|FRAME:PWY-82|).  
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>  Few UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerases have been described in the literature although this enzymatic activity has been described for several plants |CITS:[192218],[192219],[13821949],[5483919]|.  One has been purified from wheat germ extract.  When the enzymatic activity of this enzyme was tested, the reversible conversion of UDP-L-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara) to UDP-D-xylose (UDP-D-Xyl) was achieved with an equilibrium constant of 1.25 |CITS:[5483919]|.  More recently, the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MUR4</i> mutant was described which was shown to be affected in its ability to epimerize UDP-D-Xyl to UDP-L-Ara |CITS:[10517829],[12566589]|.  Although the MUR4 protein was expressed in transgenic yeast cells and shown to possess UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase activity, the corresponding enzyme has not yet been fully purified.
/
/<b>Important Note:</b>  In cell wall the majority of arabinose is in a furanose, not pyranose, configuration.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Bacteria</b>:
/
/There is also evidence for this pathway in plant-associated bacteria belonging to the family |FRAME: TAX-82115|. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that fix nitrogen in the root nodules of some leguminous plants. In |FRAME: TAX-266834| an operon was identified that contains genes <i>uxe</i> and <i>uxs1</i> encoding UDP-xylose 4-epimerase and UDP-xylose synthase 1, respectively. Data from real-time <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the conversion of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| to |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE|, and |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| to |FRAME: CPD-12513|. These UDP-sugars are then used for the biosynthesis of xylose-containing and arabinose-containing cell surface glycans. Their pathways and the roles that they play in nodulation are only beginning to be elucidated |CITS: [20847005]|.
/
/Two orthologs of each gene encoding active enzymes were also identified in other rhizobial species including |FRAME: TAX-216596| (loci R10559 and R10078 for <i>uxe</i>, R10560 and R10077 for <i>uxs</i>). These observations were cited in |CITS: [20847005]| as unpublished data.

TYPES - Pyrimidine-Nucleotide-Salvage
COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides salvage
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)"| (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)"|.
/This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.
/
/|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.
/
/In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to dTMP by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)"|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The transition element molybdenum (Mo) has been long known as an essential micronutrient across the kingdoms of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. However, molybdate itself is catalytically inactive and, with the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, needs to be activated through complexation by a special cofactor. There are several molybdenum cofactors, including |FRAME: CPD-4| (MPT), |FRAME: CPD-582| (MGD), |FRAME: CPD0-1882|, or others |CITS: [1587808]|.
/
/The chemical nature and biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactors have been investigated in detail in bacteria |CITS: [7836363][8514783][8514782][1587808][14761975]| and plants |CITS: [16669776][16784786][12147719][16234918][9421926]|. All of the different cofactors are synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-4| (MPT). The variability of the molybdenum cofactors found in bacteria is achieved by the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT.
/
/The MPT structure is conserved in all organisms and it has been demonstrated that its biosynthesis is preserved in bacteria and eukaryotes alike. It is produced from |FRAME: GTP| via |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z| (precursor Z) in three steps catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-4.1.99.22|, |FRAME: EC-4.6.1.17|, and |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.12| |CITS: [7890743][23627491]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The small subunits of MPT synthases from different organisms (such as the bacterial |FRAME:EG11597-MONOMER "MoaD"| protein) contain a double glycine motif at the C terminus. The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by an accessory protein (|FRAME:EG10154-MONOMER "MoeB"| in bacteria, |FRAME: HS04742| in humans and Cnx5 in plants) to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by the action of two sulfurtransferase, one of which is a rhodanese, resulting in a thiocarboxylate. Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.
/
/The insertion of Mo into molybdopterin, forming the biologically active prosthetic group, is catalyzed in eukaryotes by a multifunctional two-domain protein. The protein first activates |FRAME: CPD-4| to |FRAME: CPD-8122| |CITS: [15504727][ 9341109][11554796][12590921][10823911]| and then inserts molybdate into the cofactor in a step that involves AMP cleavage |CITS: [16636046][15504727]|. In a somewhat analogous manner, in |FRAME:TAX-562| the MoeA protein mediates ligation of Mo to molybdopterin while the MogA protein enhances this process in an ATP-dependent manner |CITS: [17198377]|.
/
/The insertion of Mo coincides with the release of copper bound to the molybdopterin dithiolate sulfur |CITS: [15306815]| which seems to play a more stabilizing role of MPT-AMP than being actively involved in Mo insertion |CITS: [16636046]|.
/
/The main differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways are at the enzyme level. Some of the eukaryotic enzymes are fusion proteins with two functional domains, each catalyzing a different step in the pathway, while the bacterial proteins are single domain enzymes and catalyze only a single step.

Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative ascorbate biosynthesis routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis <i>in vivo</i> have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-882|) that requires the enzymes PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure to detect PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|) |CITS:[12954627]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate contents observed in a PMI silenced line of tobacco, the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|).
/
/<B>Regulation of ascorbate biosynthesis:</B>
/
/Ascorabte biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|). Jasmonates, which have been 
/shown to increase ascorbate levels in Arabidopsis, were found to induce expression of several genes in the ascorbate biosynthesis pathway, including VTC1, GME (GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase), and VTC2/VTC5.
/In addition, VTC2/VTC5, VTC4 (L-galactose-1-P phosphatase), and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase which catalyzes the last step of the L-galactose pathway, were shown regulated by light. The enzyme activity of GME was found under feedback inhibition. Feedback inhibition of VTC2, not at the enzyme activity level, were indicated at the transcriptional level. Experiments with Arabidopsis cell suspension culture indicate that the rate limiting step in ascorbate biosynthesis occurs between D-mannose and L-galactose |CITS:[10517845], [16413588]|. GME possibly catalyzes the rate limiting step in this pathway |CITS:[16413588]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway, the pyrimidine nucleoside |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is first deaminated by |FRAME: CPLX-8106| to |FRAME: URIDINE| |CITS: [10024464][10469156]|, which is hydrolyzed by |FRAME: AT2G36310-MONOMER| to free the pyrimidine base |FRAME: URACIL| by removal of the sugar ribose group |CITS: [19293370]|.
/
/The resulting uracil base can be salvaged to form a pyrimidine nucleotide (see |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7193|). Alternatively, uracil can be degraded to |FRAME: B-ALANINE| by releasing NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in a three step reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-3982|). &beta;-Alanine is a precursor of pentothenate and coenzyme A.
/
/The overall metabolic outcome of this pathway, the conversion of |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to |FRAME: URACIL|, can also be achieved by a different pathway, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7195|.
/
/Mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: AT2G36310-MONOMER| and thus can not salvage uridine by this pathway. Instead they utilize a nucleoside kinase-based pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7183|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/An important branch-point in the biosynthesis of carotenoids lies in the cyclization of the linear, pink
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114| into carotenes with all-&beta;-, all-&epsilon;- or mixed &beta; and &epsilon; rings.
/The cyclization reactions are catalyzed by lycopene &beta;- or &epsilon;-cyclases.
/These cyclases all share a conserved amino acid sequence signature and bind dinucleotides such as
/FAD and NADP |CITS:[8837512]|, but otherwise share little resemblance.
/
/A single cyclization reaction by |FRAME: MONOMER-12151| results in the formation of
/|FRAME: CPD1F-115|. A second cyclization is performed by |FRAME: MONOMER-12154|,
/generating |FRAME: CPD1F-118|. A second cyclization by |FRAME: MONOMER-12151| is unlikely,
/as the &epsilon;-cyclase does not seem to be able to add a second &epsilon; ring to
/the monocyclic |FRAME: CPD1F-115| |CITS:[8837512]|.
/
/It has been postulated that the regulation of &epsilon;-cyclase, possibly through control of gene
/expression, determines xanthophylls composition in leaves and other plant tissues, since its products
/(&delta;-carotene) is destined to the &alpha;-carotene branch |CITS:[10205893]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/L-Asparagine is hydrolyzed to L-aspartate and ammonia by the enzyme asparaginase |CITS: [VOET04]|. The enzyme has been characterized from diverse sources, including bacteria, archaea |CITS: [15735339]|, fungi |CITS: [8026756] [7772845] [2080924]|, ciliates |CITS: [8012291]| and plants |CITS: [SODEK80]|.

/
/The enzyme has anti-tumor activity and purified L-asparaginase from |FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-556| have been used clinically to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphosarcoma (in |CITS: [15951039]|). The enzyme from some species contains glutaminase activity, believed to cause clinical side-effects. Enzyme preparations from species with decreased glutaminase activity, such as |FRAME: TAX-554 "<i>Pectobacterium carotovorum</i> (previously known as <i>Erwinia carotovora</i>)"| have been characterized as potential therapeutics |CITS: [15951039]|.
/
/<b>Asparagine Degradation in Plants</b>
/
/Asparagine is the first amino acid discovered in plants, where it is the major nitrogen transport and storage compound. Asparagine is metabolized in plants in two routes, either via asparaginase (this pathway|) or via asparagine aminotransferase (see |FRAME: PWY-4002|). Studies in pea suggested that the predominant route differs in different tissues. The asparaginase pathway predominates in seeds, whereas the aminotransferase pathway predominates in leaves |CITS: [Ireland81]|.
/
/In the asparaginase pathway, as depicted here, asparagine is deaminated to release aspartate and ammonia. The liberated ammonia is reassimilated and utilized for synthesis of all nitrogen containing compounds of the cell and in particular the amino acids. There is no evidence that aspartate is metabolized further in plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC - this pathway), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine..
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the pathway illustrated here |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, a transamination product of |FRAME: VAL|, is used as an example for the 2-oxo acid substrate of the branched-chain dehydrogenase complex (BCDHC). This reaction is summarized by the EC entry 1.2.1.25
/
/|FRAME: 1.2.1.25-RXN|. 
/
/BCDHC can also recognize |FRAME: 2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE| and |FRAME: 2-KETO-3-METHYL-VALERATE| (which are the transamination products of |FRAME: LEU| and |FRAME: ILE|, respectively), and plays a key role in the degradation of |FRAME: VAL|, |FRAME: LEU|, and |FRAME: ILE|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by photorespiration, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms. The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes. Plants possess both enzymes.
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

/|FRAME: CPD-862| is one of the major components of the volatile oil of sage (|FRAME: TAX-38868|), where it appears to function as a phytotoxin inhibiting the growth of competing grasses. Immature sage leaves synthesize and accumulate camphor most rapidly, and the camphor content of the leaves increases as they expand |CITS: [16661761]|.
/
/The first proposal for a pathway for |FRAME: CPD-862| biosynthesis suggested that |FRAME: CPD-461| was converted to |FRAME: CPD-1903|, which was then dehydrogenated to camphor |CITS: [10906]|. Subsequent studies showed that a cyclic pyrophosphate intermediate was involved |CITS: [921300]| and that the preferred precursor was |FRAME: GERANYL-PP|, rather than |FRAME: CPD-461| |CITS: [42356]|, leading to the pathway described here.
/
/The first pathway enzyme to be partially purifed and characterized was |FRAME: MONOMER-17127|, which catalyzes the last step in the pathway |CITS: [677891]|. This was followed by a partial purification of |FRAME: MONOMER-17128| |CITS: [42357]| and |FRAME: CPLX-8430| |CITS: [42356][9614092]|.

/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/ GDP-L-galactose is a nucleotide-sugar that is used as biosynthetic precursor of L-galactosyl residues in polysaccharides and oligosaccharides in plants |CITS:[15134748],[14991405]|.  The L-galactosyl residues of cell wall polysaccharides, as well as those of glycoproteins only represent relatively minor components of those compounds, which helps explain the relative scarcity of information available concerning their biosynthesis.  Importantly, GDP-L-galactose is also used in |FRAME:PWY-882| in plants.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: SIROHEME Siroheme| is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin, a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll that was discovered in 1973 |CITS: [4583265]|. Siroheme is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor for delivering electrons to substrate.
/Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, respectively.
/Assimilatory sulfite reductases (see |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME:SULFITE-REDUCT-ENZRXN|) are found in bacteria, fungi and plants but not in animals, while dissimilatory sulfite reductases are found in diverse sulfate-reducing eubacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-879| |FRAME:CPLX-266|) and some species of thermophilic archaebacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-2234| |FRAME: CPLX-7178|) |CITS: [8994874]|.
/
/Siroheme is also an intermediate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-17059| in denitrifying bacteria, and in an alternative |FRAME: Heme-b| biosynthesis pathway found in many archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria |CITS: [21969545]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Siroheme biosynthesis starts by the same route as other tetrapyrroles, the synthesis of the intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| (see |FRAME:Tetrapyrrole-Biosynthesis "tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathways"|). |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III "Uroporphyrinogen-III"| is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or factor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward
/the synthesis of chlorophyl and heme |CITS: [14633982]|.
/
/For siroheme synthesis, successive methylation at positions 2 and 7 forms |FRAME: CPD-9038| and |FRAME: DIHYDROSIROHYDROCHLORIN| (also known as dihydrosirohydrochlorin), respectively |CITS: [2407558]|. The enzyme that catalyzes the two methylation reactions, uroporphyrin III methyltransferase, requires |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as a methyl donor, and has been characterized from several sources including bacteria |CITS: [1906874][2546914]|, archaea |CITS: [1856165]|, and higher plants |CITS: [8953249]|. 
/To complete the synthesis of siroheme, |FRAME: DIHYDROSIROHYDROCHLORIN| is oxidized to |FRAME: SIROHYDROCHLORIN| and then chelated with ferrous iron. The first three intermediates are also intermediates in cobalamine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5507|), and thus the committed step in the pathway is the ultimate one, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-4.99.1.4|.
/
/There are many variations of the enzymes catalyzing this pathway. In some bacteria (for example in the Gram-positive |FRAME: TAX-1423|) the transformation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| into |FRAME:SIROHEME| is catalyzed by three separate enzymes (uroporphyrin III methyltransferase, dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase and sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase) |CITS: [12408752][10217486]|. In other organisms, such as the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932|, the last two reactions are catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme |CITS: [11980703]|. Yet in other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, a single trifunctional enzyme (|FRAME:SIROHEMESYN-CPLX|) catalyzes all four reactions |CITS: [7945210]|.
/
/Organisms that use siroheme for |FRAME: Heme-d1| biosynthesis often have very different enzymes for synthesizing siroheme. For example, in P. denitrificans the <i>nirE</i> gene, which is located in the heme <i>d</i><sub>1</sub> biosynthetic cluster, encodes the methyltransferase that catalyzes the first step, and a different ferrocheletase (Pdne_2332) that is not related to the cheletases mentioned above catalyzes the last step (the identity of the dehydrogenase is still not known in these organisms) |CITS: [24673795]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Lignans are a group of dimeric and/or oligomeric plant natural compounds of phenylpropanoid origin. They represent a structurally highly diverse compound class that is characterized by a 8,8'-linkage found in the C6-C3 dimers of coniferyl alcohol or other cinnamoyl alcohols although other interunit linkages (e.g. 8-5', 8-O-4) may also occur |CITS: [Lewis99]| |CITS: [FUSS03]|.
/
/Lignans and lignins are biosynthesized in two major branches which descend from the phenylpropanoid pathway. During the conquest of land this pathway has been substantially advanced with consequences for derivative biosyntheses such as for lignins/lignans, hydrolyzable and condensed tannins and flavonoids |CITS: [STAFFORD00]|. Lignans are widespread among the plant kingdom but have not been found in aquatic plants such as algae indicating their crucial contribution to adaptation and fitness of terrestrial plants |CITS: [AYRES90][11423139]|. The structural biopolymers lignins and lignans accomplish different tasks in plants, lignins are involved in structural support and lignans have been attributed to protection and defense as their primary physiological functions. Taken together lignins and lignans count for about 30% of carbon in vascular plants |CITS: [Lewis99]|. 
/
/Beside their recognized functions as defense compounds in plants some lignans have attracted the attention of scientists because of their application in medicine and human health |CITS: [MACRAE84]|. Lignans possess most effective health protective and curative properties and have been employed as antioxidants |CITS: [14995053]|, anti-carcinogenic agents |CITS: [10800470]| |CITS: [16311631]| and phytoestrogens |CITS: [15377220]|.
/
/Lignans can be subdivided into several structural subfamilies. The matairesinol pathway is an excellent example for a pathway that not only contains several types of lignans but also gives rise to other lignan subfamilies. (+)-pinoresinol (a furofuran) is sequentially converted to (+)-lariciresinol (a benzylaryltetrahydrofuran), (-)-secoisolariciresinol (a dibenzylbutane) and (-)-matairesinol (a dibenzylbutyrolactone) which is an intermediate in the biosynthetic route towards podophyllotoxin (an aryltetrahydronaphthalene) (compare |FRAME:PWY-5479|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway begins with the formation of |FRAME: CPD-18761| from |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|. Whether |FRAME: EC-1.11.1.7|, or |FRAME: EC-1.10.3.2|, function in the oxidation of monolignols to radicals has been under active evaluation for many years |CITS: [13657039][17812228][Sterjiades93][9914531]|. Both peroxidases and laccases were shown to catalyze the oxidation of |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL| to a radical <i>in vitro</i>  |CITS: [16027971][25626739]|. 
/
/The next step involves the stereo-specific coupling of two phenoxy radicals to form dimers. Most lignans are optically active as a result of specific regio- and stereo specificity in the coupling process. Interestingly, the proteins responsible for the linkages are not enzymes. These proteins, which were named 'dirigent proteins' (DP) serve only to bind and orientate the coniferyl alcohol-derived free radicals |CITS: [10859176][16023845][8994027]|. It could be demonstrated that dirigent proteins form a multigene family in plants |CITS: [12359517]|, and their function is not limited to the formation of lignans but also includes other biosyntheses of various phenolics employing corresponding radicals.
/
/The next step in the pathway is catalyzed by two distinct enzyme classes of pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductases (PLR). These bifunctional enzymes are stereospecific and catalyze the enantioselective reduction of either (+)-pinoresinol and (+)-lariciresinol towards (-)-secoisolaricinol (as discovered in Forsythia) |CITS: [8910615]| or (-)-pinoresinol and (-)-lariciresinol, forming (+)-secoisolaricinol, as demonstrated in western red cedar |CITS: [9872995]|.
/Similar enantiospecific enzymes have also been found in different species of the same genus |CITS: [15949826]|.
/
/Another bifunctional enzyme, |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.331| (SDH) affords the formation of |FRAME: CPD-8912| |CITS: [2037574]| via a stable lactol intermediate |CITS: [11278426]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins
/including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. 
/In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in
/transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.
/
/Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as
/|FRAME: Heme-b|, different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in
/modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|,
/|FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.
/
/The protoheme biosynthetic pathway shown here is found in some bacteria (including
/|FRAME: TAX-83333|), archaea, and plants. In these organisms the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway
/starts with glutamate (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|).
/
/In many other organisms, including animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such as the malaria parasite
/|FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [15144063]|), and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, the tetrapyrrole
/biosynthesis pathway starts with glycine and succinyl-CoA (see |FRAME:PWY-5189|).
/Both the glycine and glutamate pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing |FRAME: TAX-3039|
/(reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [15576047], [12051904], [16093570]|).
/
/Both tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways merge at the intermediate |FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE|.
/However, a branch point at |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| leads to biosynthesis of different
/compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|),
/|FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|),
/and heme D biosynthesis.
/A second branch point at |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| leads to biosynthesis of chlorophyll
/in plants and bacteriochlorophyll in photosynthetic bacteria (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).
/In eukaryotes, heme biosynthesis spans the mitochondrial (or plastid) and cytosol compartments.
/
/This topic has been reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [12177321], [16093570]|.

/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.

/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the most common route in which pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|) are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, and the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed. It is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase, EC 2.1.1.45"| (some organisms have an alternative enzyme, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6545|).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form before it can be reduced/methylated. This is achieved in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11626-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.
/
/In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: FeS-Centers "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters"| are cofators of |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur proteins"| and consist of a cluster of two to four iron atoms linked to sulfides, some of which are cysteine residues of the protein.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, Fe-S clusters are also known to participate in
/the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
/and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters in a living cell is a highly evolved process, requiring the assistance of complex assemblies of proteins. At present, three different biogenesis systems have been identified. The ISC (iron-sulfur cluster) system, which is present in &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;-proteobacteria as well as in mitochondria of eukaryotes, the SUF (sulfur mobilization) system, which is found in a wide range of bacteria (including cyanobacteria), archaea, and plastids of plants, and the NIF (nitrogen fixation) system, which is used in the synthesis of nitrogenase, but also occurs in nondiazotrophic &epsilon;-proteobacteria.
/It should be noted that the mitochondrial ISC system comprises more proteins than in bacteria, but the underlying mechanistic principles are analogous. This pathway is modeled after the bacterial ISC system.
/
/All three systems have in common two key proteins - |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| (|FRAME: G7325 IscS|/|FRAME: HS01304|, |FRAME: G6906 SufS| or NifS) and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "a scaffold protein"| (|FRAME: G7324 IscU|, SufU or NifU).
/Cysteine desulfurase is a pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzyme that converts the amino-acid |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, liberating a sulfur atom that is covalently bound as a persulfide at a conserved Cys residue of the enzyme.
/The scaffold protein, which also contains Cys residues, serves as a platform for the assembly of Fe-S clusters. The scaffold protein exists in equilibrium between two conformational states: a more structured state (S) and a partially disordered state (D) |CITS: [12909018][14688265][19492851]|. 
/
/The process begins when the cysteine desulfurase binds to the scaffold protein in its disordered state |CITS: [22203963]|. Sulfur atoms are transferred by the desulfurase from L-cysteine to the cysteine side chains of the scaffold protein, forming persulfides |CITS: [11577100]|.
/
/The process continues with the addition of two iron atoms, and the iron and sulfur atoms rearrange to form a [2Fe2S] cluster. The newly-formed cluster stabilizes the scaffold protein, transforming it to its structured state |CITS: [23333622]|. The process of iron addition is not well understood. The protein frataxin (|FRAME: EG11653 CyaY| in bacteria, |FRAME: G3O-29519| in yeast, FXN in humans) is essential for the process, and may act as a metallochaperone, but its weak iron binding activity and other observations suggest that its main role may be to maintain iron homeostasis under oxidative stress |CITS: [20956517][19932164][20522547]|. Another candidate for iron delivery is |FRAME: EG12132|, which has a strong binding activity for mononuclear iron, and has been shown to provide iron to the scaffold protein |FRAME: G7324 IscU| in the presence of |FRAME: G7325 IscS| and L-cysteine |CITS: [14720122][15828873][16877383]|.
/
/The next steps involve chaperone proteins. The first one, also known as a |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| (|FRAME: EG12131 HscB| in |FRAME:TAX-562|) binds to the scaffold protein, causing the cysteine desulfurase to fall off. The co-chaperone-scaffold protein complex then binds to another |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones chaperone| (|FRAME: EG12130 HscA|), which is an ATPase with a bound ATP molecule.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/The last step shown in the pathway is the exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.
/
/<b>About [4Fe-4S] clusters biosynthesis</b>
/
/While less is known about the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters, it seems that they are formed on the same scaffold proteins that are used for [2Fe-2S] clusters synthesis. These proteins are dimeric, and since a [2Fe-2S] cluster is formed within a single subunit, a dimeric scaffold protein can form two such clusters. Some evidence suggests that [4Fe-4S] clusters are formed at the subunit interface, involving two electron reductive coupling of the two adjacent [2Fe-2S] clusters |CITS: [19021507]|.
/
/The |FRAME: G7748 NfuA| protein has been proposed to be an intermediate [4Fe-4S] cluster carrier or chaperone for clusters assembled on |FRAME: G7324 IscU| |CITS: [18339629]| or act as a scaffold protein itself in some species |CITS: [15031412][15361144]|. The presence of |FRAME: EG12130| and |FRAME: EG12131| had no effect on the rate of [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer from |FRAME: G7324| to <i>apo</i> aconitase, suggesting different conformations for the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] cluster-bound forms of |FRAME: G7324 IscU|, with only the former having the ability to interact productively with |FRAME: EG12130 HscA| |CITS: [17506526]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Isoprenoids are among the most diverse and widely distributed natural compounds. They include both essential products (sterols, quinones, prenylated proteins, chlorophylls) and secondary metabolites (plant terpenoids and hormones) |CITS: [15024605]|.
/
/In this pathway |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| and multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) undergo a series of polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain of nine units, known as |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE| or solanesyl diphosphate.
/
/In most organisms, the enzyme that adds the isoprenyl units to form |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE| prefers |FRAME: GERANYL-PP|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5805|. However, the enzymes found in |FRAME: TAX-3702| were shown to prefer |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| |CITS: [12437513]|.
/
/Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific synthase. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones. However, the enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone
/molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/Quinones with nine isoprenyl units in the side chains are very common. They are the predominant form of plastoquinones, found in green plants and cyanobacteria, and are the major quinones in some large Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera, including the Pseudomonads and the Streptococci. Nine-isoprenyl quinones are also found in many animals, including the rat.
/
/|FRAME: ORG-5993| possesses two alleles of solanesyl diphosphate synthases - |FRAME: AT1G17050| supplies the precursor of the plastoquinone side-chain, while |FRAME: AT1G78510| contributes to the biosynthesis of the ubiquinone side-chain |CITS: [15784989]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Acyl-ACP thioesterase releases free fatty acids from Acyl-ACPs, synthesized from de novo fatty acid 
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME:FASYN-ELONG-PWY|). The reaction terminates fatty acid biosynthesis. 
/In plants, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the plastid and thus requires plastid-localized acyl-ACP 
/thioesterases. The main products of acyl-ACP thioesterase are oleate (C18:0) and to a lesser extent 
/palmitate (C16:0) in the vegetative tissues of all plants. The released free fatty acids are re-esterified to 
/coenzyme A in the plastid envelope and exported out of plastid. 
/
/There are two isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase, FatA and FatB. Substrate specificity of these isoforms 
/determines the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids in plants. The highest activity of FatA is 
/with C18:1-ACP. FatA has very low activities towards other acyl-ACPs when compared with C18:1-ACP. 
/FatB has highest activity with C16:0-ACP. It also has significant high activity with C18:1-ACP, followed 
/by C18:0-ACP and C16:1-ACP. Kinetics studies of FatA and FatB indicate that their substrate 
/specificities with different acyl-ACPs came from the Kcat values, rather than from Km. Km values of 
/the two isoforms with different substrates are similar, in the micromolar order. Domain swapping of FatA 
/and FatB indicates the N-terminus of the isoforms determines their substrate specificities |CITS: [12061798]|. 
/For those plants which predominantly accumulate medium-chain length saturated fatty acids in seeds, 
/they evolved with specialized FatB and/or FatA thioesterases |CITS: [11337402]|. For example, 
/laurate (12:0) is the predominant seed oil in coconut. Correspondingly, the medium-chain specific 
/acyl-ACP thioesterase activity was detected in coconut seeds.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The Calvin cycle is the major |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| fixation pathway, found in all in green plants and many autotrophic bacteria.
/
/In this cycle, one |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecule at a time is added to the acceptor molecule |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP) generating two molecules of |FRAME: G3P|. The |FRAME: G3P| is then passed through a cyclic series of reactions in which the acceptor molecule (RuBP) is regenerated. Out of the six carbons present in two molecules of |FRAME: G3P|, five are recycled and only one remains available for biosynthesis. Since in each turn of the cycle only one carbon atom is assimilated, the cycle must go through three turns to produce one molecule of |FRAME: G3P|, or six turns to produce one molecule of a hexose sugar.
/
/The Calvin cycle can be divided into three stages: fixation, reduction and regeneration.
/
/In the first stage the reductive carboxylation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP) is catalyzed by the the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-105| (RubisCO), forming 2 molecules of |FRAME: G3P|. 
/
/In the second stage these two molecules are phosphorylated to |FRAME: DPG| and then reductively dephosphorylated to |FRAME: GAP|. In three turns of the cycle 3 molecules of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| are fixed, and 6 molecules of |FRAME: GAP| are formed. Out of these, one is diverted to biosynthetic pathways, while the other 5 are used up in the next stage.

/The third stage is the most complicated one. It consists of a series of rearrangements that eventually regenerate RuBP.
/Some of the |FRAME:GAP| molecules are converted to |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|. |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| are then condensed into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| which is dephosphorylated to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|. |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| is then combined with another |FRAME: GAP| molecule and cleaved into |FRAME:XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE| (X5P) and |FRAME:ERYTHROSE-4P|.

/During this cycle, especially during the day, |FRAME: G3P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, or |FRAME:GAP| can be siphoned off and sent out to the cytosol via the triose phosphates transporter for |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY|. Plants need to carefully control the carbon flux between this and competeing pathways to make sure that the Calvin cycle can proceed |CITS: [19325167]|.

/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium Selenium| is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but has not yet been proven to be an essential micronutrient for land plants |CITS: [11683552][16307305]|. There is evidence, however, of Chlamydomonas proteins that contains a |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| residue suggesting that algal species might also require |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| |CITS: [17105189][12110581]|. The health requirement of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| for humans and animals can be met by crops and forage plants that contain selenocompounds. |FRAME: TAX-4232| among the oilseed crops was shown to be a good source for this micronutrient |CITS: [15012198]|. In addition, there is evidence that certain seleno-compounds, including |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE|, have anti-carcinogenic properties |CITS: [14748935]|.   
/
/Despite its importance as a micronutrient, higher concentrations of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| are toxic to humans, other animals, and plants largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064][12753978][16661781]|. 
/
/In general, plants take up both |FRAME: SELENATE| and |FRAME: SELENITE| from soil. A series of |FRAME: PWY-6932 reduction steps| converts |FRAME: SELENATE| to |FRAME: SE-2| / |FRAME: CPD-678| and this is assimilated into the seleno-amino acids |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| and |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE| |CITS: [19309459]|.
/
/In Se accumulator plants, these seleno-amino acids may be modified to create organic seleno-compounds for storage. Seasonal weeds like |FRAME: TAX-3575| and |FRAME: TAX-83445| along with perennial weeds like |FRAME: TAX-41550| employ this strategy and accumulate high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| |CITS: [19800657]|. Se accumulation can help to protect plants against attacks by prairie dogs, insects, and fungi (see refs in |CITS: [21628258]|).
/
/Other plants, like |FRAME: ORG-5993| generate seleno-compounds as well, but rather than storing them, they transform them into less toxic volatile compounds
/such as |FRAME: CPD-12005| (DMSe) that can then be released from the plants |CITS: [10759525]|. This process is also called phytovolatilization |CITS: [19656903]|.  
/
/While these strategies directly benefit the plants that employ them, they can also be put to use for the phytoremediation  of seleniferous soils that contain dangerously high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium|. Numerous insights into endogenous seleno-compound metabolism in plants have been gained through efforts to engineer plants that show improved selenium phytoremediation abilities |CITS: [15005814][19800657][19893365][17445958][10759525]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/Selenocysteine formation likely parallels the cysteine biosynthetic pathway in plants, and may use many of the same enzymes.The first step in cysteine biosynthesis involes a serine acetyltransferase (SAT). While there is definite evidence of enzymes capable of producing O-acetyl-L-serine in Arabidopsis and many other plant species, these enzymes have not yet been explicitly linked to selenium metabolism <i>in planta</i>. In fact, when SAT activity is compared across different |FRAME:TAX-20400| species that accumulate vastly different levels of selenium, no correlation is detected |CITS: [    15941393]|. Selenocysteine formation is likely to be catalyzed by O-acetyl-L-serine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) enzymes and selenocysteine production in the presence of O-acteyl-serine has been measured in a number of plants including including |FRAME:TAX-3888| (pea), clover, and several <i>Astralagus</i> species |CITS: [NG78]|. This activity could be competitively inhibited by sulfur, and conversely, cysteine biosynthesis could be competetively inhibited by selenium, arguing that these reactions are catalyzed by the same enzymes |CITS: [NG78]|. Direct evidence for OAS-TL-based production of selenocysteine has only been demonstrated in the bacteria |FRAME:TAX-266| to date |CITS: [14692]|, but it is likely that plant OAS-TLs catalyze this reaction, too.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13717| production probably depends on the activity of the cystathionine synthase enzymes that play a comparable role in sulfate metabolism. Over-expression of an Arabidopsis |FRAME: AT3G01120|  enzyme in |FRAME:TAX-3707| appears to increase flux through this pathway and leads to higher levels of volatile selenium compound production |CITS: [14618405]|.
/
/Evidence for activity of the next enzyme in the pathway, &beta;-(seleno)cystathionine lyase can be detected in plant extracts from several species including selenium non-accumulators, such as spinach (see |FRAME: MONOMER-16912| ), pea and Se accumulators, such as |FRAME:TAX-20406|. As seen for many other enzymes in this pathway, it is active with both the sulfur and selenium analogs |CITS: [MCCLUSKEY86]|.
/
/The final step toward selenomethionine biosynthesis could be catalyzed by at least three different types of enzymes if the proteins involved in |FRAME: PWY-702| also participate in selenomethionine (Se-Met) metabolism. For instance, <i>E.coli</i> has both cobalamin-dependent (2.1.1.13) and cobalamin-independent enzymes (|FRAME: RXN-12730 2.1.1.14|) that can catalyze the formation of Se-Met |CITS: [11078203]|. No cobalamin-independent candidates have been found in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, it does have three cobalamin-independent methionine synthases (see |FRAME: RXN-12730 2.1.14|) which could also potentially accept selenohomocysteine, but their role in seleno-amino acid biosynthesis has not yet been tested |CITS: [15024005]|.  
/
/These seleno-amino acids can be misincorporated during protein synthesis. To prevent this, selenium accumulating or hyperaccumulating plants typically transform them into non-coding seleno-amino acids, such as Se-methylselenocysteine or other related compounds. Non-accumulating plants employ a different strategy and further metabolize these seleno-amino acids into the production of volatile compounds that can be released into the atmosphere |CITS: [16307305]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/All cyanobacterial membranes contain alkanes and/or alkenes of 1519 carbons at concentrations similar to that of chlorophyll. The most common alkanes observed are |FRAME: CPD-7946| and |FRAME: HEPTADECANE-CPD| |CITS:[17731762][McInnes80][12495426]|. These alkanes are prduced from fatty acids in three steps - activation of the fatty acid by an |FRAME: ACP "acyl-carrier-protein"|, reduction of the activated fatty acid to an aldehyde, and decarbonylation of the aldehyde, resulting in an alkane that is one carbon short of the original fatty acids. Since most fatty acids have an even number of carbons (fatty acids are synthesized by the addition of two carbon units), the resulting alkanes have an odd number of carbons.
/
/It should be noted that alkanes are produced in other organisms as well - for example, in the |FRAME: PWY-282 "production of plant cuticular waxes"| |CITS: [18251711]|, as |FRAME: PWY-7035 "insect pheromones"| |CITS: [7937826][10406089]|, in green algae |CITS: [1898004][15630516]|, in fungi |CITS: [18957585]| and in bacteria other than cyanobacteria |CITS:[ 6025301][15170379]|. The final step in the synthesis of n-hydrocarbons in animals and higher plants is thought to involve enzymatic decarbonylation of aldehydes to the corresponding alkanes |CITS: [3343228][1608940][12467640]|.
/
/Recently the genes that are responsible for alkane biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, which also involve decarbonylation, have been identified and cloned from several strains of cyanobacteria |CITS: [20061450][20671186]|. 
/
/While long-chain activated fatty acids can be generated in cyanobacteria <i>de novo</i> (via the elongase complex),it has been shown that they can also be generated from free fatty acids (provided either externally or by lipid degradation) by the action of |FRAME: MONOMER-17302| |CITS: [20061450]|.
/
/The conversion of the activated fatty acids to alkanes is catalyzed by two enzymes, the products of the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1594| and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1593| genes, which encode an |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1594-MONOMER| and an |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1593-MONOMER|, respectively.
/These two genes are located next to each other on the chromosomes of most strains that were studied, and appear to form an operon. In |FRAME: TAX-1140| the two genes reside in an operon with a third gene, <i>accA</i>, which encodes the &alpha; subunit of the carboxyl transferase component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
/Extracts of |FRAME:TAX-562| expressing the two genes contained substantial quantities of odd-chain alkanes and alkenes.
/
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1593-MONOMER "Aldehyde decarbonylase"| was originally thought to produce |FRAME: CARBON-MONOXIDE| like the enzymes from higher plants and green algae. However, the most recent studies showed that the actual product of the cyanobacterial enzyme is |FRAME: FORMATE| |CITS: [21341652]|. There was some controversy regarding the actual reaction. While some researcher found that the enzyme requires oxygen |CITS: [21671322][21462983]|, others reported that the enzyme is much more active anaerobically |CITS: [22074177]|. However, additional work verified that the enzyme is indeed an oxygenase |CITS: [22947199]|.
/
/A mutant of |FRAME: TAX-1148| that does not produce alkanes exhibited enhanced cyclic electron flow, in which electrons from photosystem I (PSI) were returned to the |FRAME: Plastoquinols plastoquinone| pool, resulting in a slower growth rate |CITS: [26459862]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates
/form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, for use in biosynthesis.  The
/pathway for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for
/|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
/pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
/enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
/|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
/necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
/precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
/and reducing power.  In |FRAME:TAX-562| they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
/expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
/precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
/gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
/ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
/with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
/glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
/form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
/The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
/nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
/(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
/|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
/DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
/synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
/that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
/anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
/from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
/or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.
/
/The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
/and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
/and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
/However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
/plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
/ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
/gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
/and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
/|CITS: [16771665]|.
/
/The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
/precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|
/to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|. 
/This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to
/be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an
/alternate <i>de novo</i> deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes
/|CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of
/|FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by
/|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is
/catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product
/of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<i>N</i>-linked glycosylation is an important process found in eukaryotes and archaea, and very rarely in bacteria.
/During this process certain oligosaccharides are attached to an asparagine residue in the polypeptide chain of the target protein. It has been shown that the glycosylation is essential for the proper folding of some eukaryotic proteins.
/
/In Eukaryotes, most <i>N</i>-linked oligosaccharides derive from a branched 14-residue sugar (a tetradecasaccharide) precursor that contains 3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine residues, which is attached to a carrier molecule called |FRAME: DOLICHOLP "dolichol phosphate"|. The structure of this precursor is common to most eukaryotes - animals, plants, most fungi, and the protist |FRAME:TAX-3039| use this tetradecasaccharide precursor, although other protists are konwn to differ in the composition of the precursor |CITS: [6088086][DELACANAL][15665075]|. The pathway for the biosynthesis of the precursor is highly conserved.
/
/While archaea use different oligosaccharides and use somewhat different dolichol carriers, the archaeal pathway is in general similar to the eukaryotic one, and there is even sequence similarity between some of the eukaryotic, bacterial and arachaeal glycosyltransferases involved in the process |CITS: [9878760]| (see for example |FRAME: PWY-7658|).
/
/The eukaryotic biosynthetic pathway begins with the phosphorylation of dolichol, followed by stepwise addition of sugar residues to form the product dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide. This pathway is of particular interest in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation. The genetic analysis of this pathway in a model organism, the budding yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932|, has helped to elucidate the molecular basis of these disorders (reviewed in |CITS: [11306275]|). Humanization of the N-glycosylation pathway in yeast may allow production of therapeutically useful glycoproteins. Humanization is necessary because <i>N</i>-glycosylation in yeast is of a higher-mannose type, which would create a shorter glycoprotein half-life in humans |CITS: [15685223]|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4932|, the polyisoprenol |FRAME: DOLICHOL dolichol| contains 14 to 18 isoprene units, with 15 or 16 as the predominant components (|CITS: [4580884]|, and reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). It is synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate produced by the |FRAME: PWY-922 "mevalonate pathway"| (see |FRAME: PWY-5123| and |FRAME: PWY-6129|). Dolichol can be phosphorylated <i>de novo</i> to dolichyl phosphate by the CTP-mediated |FRAME: YMR013C-MONOMER|, the product of gene |FRAME: YMR013C| |CITS: [2657387][1323123]|. Dolichyl phosphate can also be regenerated by other reactions (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|).
/
/Dolichyl phosphate is the essential carrier lipid for glycosyl residues. Each of the glycosyl residues is added by a specific glycosyltransferase |CITS: [10336995]|, (in |CITS: [15665075][15044395]|), reviewed in |CITS: [9878760][15189166]|. The substrate specificity of these enzymes results in a highly ordered assembly of glycosyl residues |CITS: [10336995]|. In |FRAME: TAX-4932|, Alg (Asparagine-linked glycosylation) mutants of the glycosyltransferases have been isolated and the accumulated dolichyl-diphospho-glycan intermediates analyzed. On the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, glycosyltransferase |FRAME: YBR243C| adds phospho-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine to dolichol-P; |FRAME: G3O-28| and |FRAME: G3O-29| form a complex that adds <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [16100113][16100110][15615718]|; |FRAME: YBR110W| adds the first mannose residue; |FRAME: YGL065C| adds the second and third mannose residues |CITS: [16878994]|; and |FRAME: YNL048W| adds the fourth and fifth mannose residues |CITS: [16878994]|, creating the (mannosyl)<sub>5</sub>-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)<sub>2</sub>-diphosphodolichol intermediate |CITS: [11278778]|, (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|).  There is evidence that |FRAME: YBR110W|, |FRAME: YGL065C| and |FRAME: YNL048W| are physically associated in oligomeric complexes, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism |CITS: [15044395]|.
/
/After the fifth mannose residue is added, the dolichol-diphospho-glycan is translocated (flipped) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by a "flippase". It has been initially thought that the flippase is encoded by the |FRAME: G3O-28923| gene, but that has proven incorrect, and the identity of the flippase is still unknown. Mannosyltransferases in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, |FRAME: YBL082C|, |FRAME: YNL219C|, and |FRAME: YNR030W| use dolichyl &beta;-D-mannosyl phosphate, synthesized by the product of gene |FRAME: YPR183W|, as a sugar donor to add other mannose residues.  Also in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, dolichyl &beta;-D-glycosyl phosphate, synthesized by |FRAME: YPL227C|, is the sugar donor to add the three glucose residues via |FRAME: YOR002W|, |FRAME: YOR067C|, and |FRAME: YGR227W| (|CITS: [15987956]| and reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|).
/
/Note that the seven sugars added outside the ER are nucleoside-activated, while the seven sugars added inside the lumen are derived from individually charged and flipped phosphodolichol carriers.
/
/This core lipid-linked oligosaccharide, (glucosyl)<sub>3</sub>(mannosyl)<sub>9</sub>-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)<sub>2</sub>-diphosphodolichol (|FRAME: OLIGOSACCHARIDE-DIPHOSPHODOLICHOL|), is then transferred by the |FRAME: CPLX3O-10527| (OST) to asparagine residues within the recognition sequence asparagine-x-threonine/serine (N-X-T/S) on nascent polypeptides |CITS: [9405463][11580295]|.  During the transfer |FRAME: CPD-224| is released in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is cleaved by a dolichyl diphosphate phosphatase to |FRAME: DOLICHOLP|.  Mechanisms for recycling of this dolichyl phosphate have been proposed |CITS: [18077451]|.
/
/In higher eukaryotes, further processing of the glycosylated, nascent polypeptide by enzymatic glucose addition and removal serves as a quality control mechanism for improperly folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, although this mechanism appears to be modified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| |CITS: [9451025]|.  Final glycosylation of properly folded proteins occurrs in the golgi (reviewed in |CITS: [8472892]|).  In |FRAME: TAX-4932|,  expression of the <i>alg</i> genes may also have a role in regulation of the cell cycle (reviewed in |CITS: [9878828]|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"|-containing phospholipids play an important role in the control of cellular functions within eukaryotic cells, being part of the intracellular signal transductions pathways from various regulators, including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and serum |CITS: [164246]|. When these regulators interact with their receptors in cell membranes, they induce the hydrolysis of certain |FRAME: Phosphoinositides "phosphoinositides"| to produce second messenger molecules.
/
/A particularly important reaction is the cleavage of |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "1-phosphatidyl-1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate"|, which produces two important secondary messaengers.
/One of the cleavage products, |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE|, mobilizes |FRAME: CA+2| ions from intracellular vesicular stores |CITS: [6605482][6146314]| while the other product, |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol"|, activates |FRAME: HS07962-MONOMER "protein kinase C"| |CITS: [438153][6232463]|, resulting in a variety of biochemical and pharmacological responses. The second messengers derived from inositol phospholipids are crucial for initiation of cellular activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
/
/Variability in the sensitivity of individual receptors to |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| is a key factor that determines whether transient fluxes of |FRAME: CA+2| release are destined to remain a localized phenomenon, or instead are recruited to produce calcium waves that sweep across the cell.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols "Phosphatidylinositol"| is synthesized from |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL "CDP-diacylglycerol"| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| by phosphatidylinositol synthase.
/
/This compound can be phosphorylated by several kinases. In this pathway, it is converted by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes to |FRAME: CPD-1108 "phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate"|,  which is phosphorylated again by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases to form |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA  "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"|. Even though it has been shown that |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| is also synthesized from |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| |CITS: [9367159]|, it is generally accepted that the majority of the |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA  "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| in mammalian cells comes from |FRAME: CPD-1108 "phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate"| phosphorylation |CITS: [12897244]|.
/
/
/The last step in this pathway, which is the most important, is catalyzed by phospholipase C enzymes. These enzymes, acting in response to receptor activation, cleave |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate"| to |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "1,2-diacylglycerol"| (DAG) and
/|FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| (IP3).
/
/This signal transduction pathway is common to all eukaryotes, and these enzymes are found from yeast to mammals |CITS: [4301226]|. However, while yeast only have one or two isoform for each enzyme, mammals have very many isoforms (not all of which are presented here) that are expressed in different tissues and under different circumstances. The presence of so many isoforms enables the transducton of multiple signals without interference in complex networks of signaling cascades that are not yet well understood |CITS: [18341203]|.
/
/For example, humans have at least four isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, four isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, and eleven isoforms of phospholipase C enzymes that belong to at least six distinct classes |CITS: [11395409][12117804][17895620]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Some of the most prevalent fatty acids in lipid storage tissues, such as |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| and |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID|, contain <i>cis</i>-double bonds on even-numbered carbons. When such fatty acids are processed by the first enzyme of the core &beta;-oxidation pathway, |FRAME: CPLX-7064| (see |FRAME: PWY-5136|), they are converted into |FRAME: 2-trans-4-cis-dienoyl-CoAs|. This intermediate cannot proceed directly through the core &beta;-oxidation pathway, and must be processed via either of two alternative routes.
/
/In the first route |FRAME: 2-trans-4-cis-dienoyl-CoAs| enters the so called reductase/isomerase pathway, which involves the enzymes |FRAME: MONOMER-12061| and |FRAME: CPLX-7065|. In this route the dienoyl-CoA is converted to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-COA|, which can be processed further by the core &beta;-oxidation pathway.
/
/Alternatively, |FRAME: 2-trans-4-cis-dienoyl-CoAs| can be converted to |FRAME: Cis-2-enoyl-CoAs| through one more cycle of core beta-oxidation pathway. A <i>cis</i>-2-enoyl-CoA cannot be completely degraded via the core &beta;-oxidation pathway since its hydratation yields |FRAME: D-3-HYDROXYACYL-COA| which is not a substrate for |FRAME:ENZRXN-12592|. Thus, the D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA enters the so called epimerase pathway that involves converting
/|FRAME: D-3-HYDROXYACYL-COA| to |FRAME: L-3-HYDROXYACYL-COA| by |FRAME: ENZRXN-12606|. Alternatively, this conversion can be performed by two stereo-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases. The L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA then returns to the core &beta;-oxidation pathway for complete degradation.
/
/The |FRAME:EC-5.3.3.8 "enoyl-CoA isomerase"| and |FRAME: EC-5.1.2.3 "3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase"| activities, together with two enzyme activities also found in the core &beta;-oxidation pathway, namely |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.17 "2-enoyl-CoA hydratase"| and |FRAME:EC-1.1.1.35 "3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase"|, are attributed to a single multifunctional protein (MFP).
/
/Studies in |FRAME: TAX-3659| cotyledon suggested the epimerase pathway is much more effective than the reductase/isomerase pathway |CITS: [1879422]|, whereas studies in |FRAME: ORG-5993| indicated that both pathways have a similar contribution |CITS: [11080293]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: SUCROSE Sucrose| is the major product of photosynthesis in most plants and is known to be essential for their growth, development, carbon storage, signal transduction and stress protection |CITS: [11005202]|.
/Sucrose is also found in cyanobacteria, and the ability to synthesize sucrose is a widespread feature of these organisms |CITS: [21054739]|. In addition, sucrose is produced by many nonphotosynthetic aerobic methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria |CITS: [1055047][12656177][14529181][23808151][23865613]|.
/
/In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| by enzymes of the |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY gluconeogenesis| pathway. In plants, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| is used to synthesize sucrose, the form in which most fixed organic carbon is translocated from photosynthetic tissue to non-photosynthetic organs. Sucrose also provides substrates for plant storage glycosides such as |FRAME: Starch starch| and |FRAME: Fructans fructans|. Storage glycosides, including sucrose, are mobilized and utilized during seed germination and plant growth.
/
/In marine and freshwater cyanobacteria, sucrose fulfils a different role. It is often synthesized in response to salt or temperature stress and seems to maintain the osmotic balance and to stabilize protein and membrane structure and function |CITS: [Reed86][7854254]|. Methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria also synthesize sucrose as a secondary osmotic compound, along with the major compatible solute |FRAME: ECTOINE| (see |FRAME: PWY-7347|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Organisms produce hydrocarbons of different types by different mechanisms.
/Several mechanisms have been described for the production of hydrocarbons from fatty acids or their intermediates, including synthesis of alkanes from fatty aldehydes by decarbonylation (see |FRAME: PWY-7032| and |FRAME: PWY-7033|), synthesis of long-chain olefins by head-to head condensation of fatty acids (see for example |FRAME: PWY-7027|), and production of alkenes from fatty acids by decarboxylation (see |FRAME: PWY-7026| and |FRAME: PWY-7029|).
/
/|FRAME: 1-Alkenes 1-Alkenes| are acyclic hydrocarbons with a single carbon-carbon double bond at the very end of the molecule. Terminal olefins are similar, but may contain additional double bonds throughout the molecule. They are natural products that have important industrial applications as both fuels and chemicals. 1-Alkenes have been reported to occur in both prokaryotes eukaryotes, and are produced by several mechanisms. One such mechanism is the decarbonylation of unsaturated fatty aldehydes |CITS:[17731762][Tornabene82][3343228][Ladygina06]|. However, in some cases the alkenes are synthesized by decarboxylation of free fatty acids. Examples are |FRAME: CPD-14227| in beetles of the genus |FRAME: TAX-7069| |CITS: [Goergen90][Villaverde07]|, |FRAME: CPD-14223| and related higher unsaturated polyenes in plants such as |FRAME: TAX-4222| |CITS: [2583180][3816783]|, and C23-C33 dienes and trienes in the green microalga |FRAME: TAX-869302|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The locations of double bonds and the stereochemistry of the <i>n</i>-alkadienes produced by the green algae |FRAME: TAX-869302| resemble that of |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD|, suggesting that oleate is the direct precursor of the <i>n</i>-alkadienes. Oleate is first extended by successive addition of C2 units derived from malonyl Co-A. Once the appropriate chain length is attained, the compound is decarboxylated and released from the complex. This system that has been named the elongation-decarboxylation mechanism |CITS: [Templier84]|. 
/
/An isomerization system in |FRAME: TAX-38881| converts |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| to |FRAME: CPD-14260|, resulting in production of both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> dienes |CITS: [Yong86][12405558]|.
/
/The cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-32049| produces several terminal olefins |CITS: [17731762]|, the major ones being |FRAME: CPD-14220| and |FRAME: CPD-14252|, although |FRAME: CPD-14229| and an unspecified form of octadecadiene are also formed |CITS: [21531827]|. These terminal olefins are produced from fatty-acyl-[acp] molecules that are one carbon shorter than the olefins in the same elongation-decarboxylation process that has been described in |FRAME: TAX-38881|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-32049| this transformation is catalyzed by a single large polyketide synthase (PKS) that is encoded by the |FRAME: G-15088| gene |CITS: [21531827]|. The synthase, which includes eight domains, catalyzes the transfer of the activated fatty acyl from a free carrier protein to an internal acyl-carrier protein module. Once loaded, a central extension module adds two carbons from malonyl-coenzyme A  to the acyl-substrate (the third carbon is released as a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule) and reduces the &beta;-keto group to a &beta;-hydroxyl. The &beta;-hydroxyl group is activated via sulfation, and subsequently dehydrated, decarboxylated, and finally cleaved off as a terminal olefin |CITS: [21531827]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The homoserine biosynthesis pathway is a three-step pathway that converts L-aspartate

/is repressed by abundant methionine. <i>thrA</i> is regulated by threonine- and isoleucine-dependent
/attenuation, and both the aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of ThrA are
/inhibited by threonine. The middle enzymatic activity, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, is subject

COMMON-NAME - fatty acid &beta;-oxidation II (peroxisome)
CITATIONS - PMNIC2017:EV-IC
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The major site for fatty acid &beta;-oxidation in animal cells is the mitochondrion, although partial &beta;-oxidation has also been shown to occur in peroxisomes (see pathway |FRAME: PWY66-391|) (reviewed in |CITS: [20558530][21683154]|). In plant cells, on the other hand, the major sites are the peroxisome and glyoxysome (a specialized peroxisome found only in germinating seeds). The mitochondrion is also active, but is most likely responsible only for degradation of branched-chain fatty acids.
/
/Another major difference lies in the structure of the enzymes. In animal mitochondria, after initial metabolism of long chain acyl-CoAs by membrane-bound enzymes, medium and short chain acyl-CoAs are metabolized in the matrix by separate soluble enzymes. In contrast, plant and animal peroxisomes and plant glyoxysomes contain multifunctional proteins (MFPs) that catalyze multiple steps of the pathway. Plant MFPs appear to have <i>S</i> stereospecificity, whereas the fungal counterparts are <i>R</i> stereospecific (see |FRAME:PWY-7288|). Mammals contain two distinct MFPs, one with <i>S</i> and the other with <i>R</i> stereospecificity (reviewed in |CITS: [17434787][17028011][20558530][20195903]|).
/
/The main biochemical difference between the animal mitochondrial and bacterial &beta;-oxidation pathway (see |FRAME: FAO-PWY|) and the plant and animal peroxisomal counterpart lies in the first step, which converts |FRAME: ACYL-COA| to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-COA|. In bacteria or animal mitochondria, this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: ACYLCOADEHYDROG-MONOMER|. The electrons removed by the oxidation pass through the respiratory chain to oxygen, generating water as the final product. In plant and animal peroxisomes, this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-7064|. The electrons pass directly to oxygen and produce |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|, which is immediately cleaved by peroxisomal catalases.       
/
/It is still debated whether fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoAs prior to or after their transport into peroxisomes. Two peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthetases have been recently identified and characterized from |FRAME: ORG-5993| |CITS: [12366803]|. Both enzymes are able to activate the full spectrum of fatty acids naturally found in the seed, and both genes are strongly induced during seed germination. These observations suggest that the two peroxisomal enzymes are involved in the fatty acid &beta;-oxidation pathway. Reviewed in |CITS: [11755682]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "All-<i>trans</i>-geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| (also known as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, or GGPP) is a crucial compound involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of terpenes and terpenoids, including central compounds such as ubiquinones and menaquinones.
/
/In plants, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of essentail compounds such as chlorophylls, carotenoids, tocopherols, plastoquinones, and gibberellins |CITS:[12427975]|, as well as a variety of secondary metabolites.
/
/In addition, GGPP is also used in posttranslational modifications of proteins (geranylgeranylation) which is important for membrane adhesion as well as the function of some proteins |CITS:[11500541][16183844]|.
/
/GGPP is synthesized from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| either by dedicated enzymes, such as the |FRAME: YPL069C-MONOMER| of |FRAME: TAX-4932|, or by the action of polyprenyl transferases such as the |FRAME: MONOMER-13766| from |FRAME: TAX-1061| or |FRAME: CPLX0-7426| from |FRAME: TAX-83333|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose joined by an &alpha;(1,2) glycosidic linkage. Some microorganisms can utilize sucrose by transporting it into the cell via specific permeases. It can then undergo hydrolysis (as shown in MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: SUCUTIL-PWY|), or phosphorolysis as shown here. This pathway occurs in the genus |FRAME:TAX-1678|. These saccharolytic, obligate anaerobes are commensals in the gut of humans and animals, and are thought to contribute to health |CITS: [15660210]|.
/
/The genes for the initial steps of sucrose degradation have been shown to be organized into an operon in |FRAME:TAX-302911| and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>.  This includes a transporter <i>scrT</i> (predicted to be a solute-cation symporter), sucrose phosphorylase <i>scrP</i>, and a repressor <i>scrR</i> (reviewed in |CITS: [15660210]|).  An additional sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme, the product of gene <i>bfrA</i> has been reported in |FRAME:TAX-302911| |CITS: [12732943]|.
/
/In this pathway, after sucrose is transported into the cell, it is cleaved by sucrose phosphorylase.  The product fructose is phosphorylated by fructokinase |CITS: [15375133]|.  A gene <i>pgm</i> encoding phosphoglucomutase, which catalyzes reaction EC 5.4.2.2, has been predicted in <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> |CITS: [12381787]|. The &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate product of this reaction can spontaneously and reversibly convert to the beta anomer and form an equilibrium mixture (EC 5.1.3.15). This conversion has also been shown to be catalyzed by an epimerase in other organisms |CITS: [11946648] [1092547]|. &beta;-D-Glucose-6-phosphate can be isomerized to D-fructose-6-phosphate (EC 5.3.1.9).  A gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate isomerase has been predicted in <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> |CITS: [12381787]|.  
/
/Interestingly, a fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) pathway (bifidobacterial shunt) has been described in bifidobacteria for the metabolism of glucose (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P124-PWY|). The fructose-6-phosphate produced in the pathway shown here is further metabolized via this pathway, as indicated by the pathway link.  In the F6PPK pathway, phosphoketolase catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to D-erythrose-4-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate.  In some species it can also act on xylulose-5-phosphate (in |CITS: [11292814]|).  This enzyme, along with a transaldolase and a transketolase, catalyzes the formation of other central metabolic intermediates which the organism can ferment to acetate and lactate |CITS: [16077128] [15375133]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE "4-Aminobenzoate"| is an important metabolic intermediate, leading to the biosynthesis of various products such as |FRAME: All-Folates folates|, |FRAME: Ubiquinones ubiquinone| (in eukaryotes), and various bacterial antibiotics (e.g.. |FRAME: Candicidins|).
/
/|FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE "4-Aminobenzoate"| is produced from |FRAME: CHORISMATE| in two steps. In the first step |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.85|, synthesizes |FRAME: 4-AMINO-4-DEOXYCHORISMATE| from |FRAME: CHORISMATE| and |FRAME: GLN|. The enzyme is composed from two subunit, PabA and PabB (in some organisms they are fused together into a bifunctional protein). PabA functions as a glutaminase, but only when in complex with PabB. PabB is an aminodeoxychorismate synthase that utilizes chorismate, and the nacent ammonia derived from glutamine hydrolysis by PabA, as substrates. In the absence of PabA, PabB can utilize added ammonia (at a reduced rate) to aminate chorismate and produce 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate |CITS: [1637823][ANDERSONK91][2251281]|.
/
/In the second step |FRAME: EC-4.1.3.38| (PabC), forms the final product. The reaction involves the elimination of pyruvate from 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate with concomitant aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring. The enzyme is classified as an &alpha;,&beta;-lyase of the fold-type IV family, and requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate for activity |CITS: [11011151]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698180034:bxue
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This superpathway illustrates the universal <i>do novo</i> biosynthetic route for producing pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|), and the most common route in which these ribonucleotides are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides, including the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. This pathway is universal, and is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase"| (EC 2.1.1.45).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form. This is done in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|. The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11626-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.
/
/In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP|. |FRAME: DCDP| is phosphorylated to |FRAME: DCTP|, followed by deamination to |FRAME: DUTP| and hydrolysis to |FRAME: DUMP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|).

/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/
/|FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| (farnesyl pyrophosphate, FPP) is a crucial compound involved in the

/[16179482]|) where IPP and DMAPP may originate from the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY|
/instead of the mevalonate pathway.
/
/The synthesis of FPP is the result of two head-to-tail condensation reactions: first
/|FRAME: GERANYL-PP| (geranyl pyrophosphate, GPP) is formed from the condensation of DMAPP
/and IPP; then another IPP molecule is added to form FPP.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Polyunsaturated |FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "long chain fatty acids"| (PUFAs) have18 or more carbon atoms containing more than one double bond in its backbone. The PUFAs that have 2 or more cis double bonds separated from each other by a single methylene group are generally either &omega;3 or &omega;6 fatty acids, and are considered essential fatty acids for mammals.
/
/PUFAs accumulate in many algae, mosses and ferns, where they are found in all major glycerol lipids and represent major constituents of membranes |CITS: [16728405]|. They are also produced by some marine bacteria, but are not commonly found in higher plants. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-10244 Docosahexanoate| (DHA) is a 22 carbon long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) with 6 methylene interrupted <i>cis</i> double bonds |CITS: [15292371]|. DHA and other LCPUFAs like |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID arachidonate| and |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE eicosapentaenoate| are precursors of different classes of eicosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important mammalian functions |CITS: [14704315]|. 
/
/In algae, fungi and lower plants DHA is synthesized <i>de novo</i> from acetate. Mammals are not able to synthesis DHA <i>de novo</i>, and instead synthesize it from the essential fatty acid |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| (which they obtain in their diet) via alternating steps of aerobic desaturation and elongation |CITS: [11397798][14704315]|.
/
/Another method of DHA synthesis is described in some marine bacteria and primitive eukaryotes utilizing the polyketide syntase systems |CITS: [12835316]| (see |FRAME: PWY-7585|).
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/For simplicity, this pathway begins with |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE|, in its lipid-incorporated form, which is the form found in most cells. Different organisms produce this 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid by different routes, which are described by the pathway links in the diagram.
/Once |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE| is transferred from the lipid to a coenzyme A carrier, it is elongated to |FRAME: CPD-13792 docosapentaenoate| via a |FRAME: MONOMER-16977|. The elongated fatty acid is transferred back to a lipid, where it undergoes a 4-desaturation by |FRAME: MONOMER-16978| to yield DHA |CITS: [11397798]|.
/
/Mammals were thought to synthesize DHA only via a 4-desaturase-independent pathway, involving an additional &Delta;7 elongation and a 6-desaturation step in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by a two carbon shortening via limited &beta;-oxidation in peroxisomes |CITS: [10903473]| (see |FRAME: PWY-7606|). However, that fact has been challenged following the finding that the desaturase enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: HS05918| gene can also catalyze 4-desaturation reactions |CITS: [26065859]| (see |FRAME: PWY-7727|).

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside salvage
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698180034:bxue
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)"|, (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)"|.
/This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.
/|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.
/Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.
/
/In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to |FRAME: TMP| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)"|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/It has been said that no biological compound functions in as many different types of biological reactions
/as |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (known as SAM or AdoMet). It is probably second only to ATP
/in the variety of reactions for which it serves as a cofactor.
/SAM is found in all living organisms, and fulfils three important roles:
/
/*  In transmethylation, SAM is the principal biological methyl donor.
/
/*  In transsulfuration, the sulfur atom of the SAM is converted via a series of enzymatic steps to cysteine,
/a precursor of taurine and glutathione, a major cellular anti-oxidant.
/
/*  In polyamine biosynthesis, SAM is the donor of aminopropyl groups.
/
/The structure of SAM was first elucidated by Cantoni in 1951 |CITS: [Cantoni51]|.
/The key to SAM's activity lies in the presence of the high energy sulfonium ion, which activates each
/of the attached carbons toward nucleophilic attack. In most cases, SAM reacts by transfer of the
/S-methyl group to a long list of possible acceptors in transmethylation reactions.
/
/SAM is synthesized in the cytosol of every cell from |FRAME: MET| and |FRAME: ATP|, in a reaction
/catalyzed by |FRAME: S-ADENMETSYN-ENZRXN|. In animals, up to half of the daily intake of
/|FRAME: MET| is converted to SAM.
/In this unusual reaction, the adenosyl moiety of ATP is transferred to methionine, forming a sulfonium
/ion which is a high energy reagent that can easily transfer its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor
/substrates including nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, biologic amines, and a long list of small
/molecules |CITS: [Lu00]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In eukaryotic organisms sulfite is generated endogenously by the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids such as
/methionine and cysteine. In addition, sulfite is formed from sulfur dioxide, an environmental pollutant, and is provided exogenously, either as a constituent of certain fruits, or as a preservative in dried fruits, vegetables and wine |CITS: [8586770]|.
/
/Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is a metallohemoprotein with molybdenum and protoheme as prosthetic groups mainly found in eukaryotes. The enzyme is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and is active mostly in the liver, where it catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. This oxidation is the terminal reaction in the oxidative degradation of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine (see |FRAME: PWY-5328|).
/
/The enzyme has been isolated from different sources and exists as a homodimer of molecular weight in the range 101-110 kDa. Each subunit can be proteolytically cleaved into two domains |CITS:[14956]|, the smaller of which contains a <i>b<sub>5</sub></i> cytochrome, while the larger harbors a molybdenum cofactor |CITS: [9242907]|.
/
/Sulfite oxidase deficiency is a lethal genetic disease that results from defects either in the genes encoding proteins involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis or in the sulfite oxidase gene itself |CITS: [16048997]|.
/
/<b>In plants</b>
/
/Sulfite in excess will cause damage to the organism, by breaking disulfide bridges (sulfitolysis), forming metabolic inhibitors such as hydroxysulfonates and interfere with the availability of essential cations required for nutrition |CITS: [Heber98]|.
/
/Sulfite oxidation is different in plants and animals. In vertebrates the role of sulfite oxidation lays in the detoxification of sulfite derived from the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids. Plants assimilate sulfur by reducing sulfate via sulfite to sulfide to form cysteine. One major point is the different location of sulfite oxidase (SO). The enzyme is found in vertebrates in the mitochondria whereas the plant SO has been localized to the peroxisome |CITS: [15653809]|. Sulfite oxidation constitutes a converse pathway to sulfate assimilation which has been found in chloroplasts. Therefore, peroxisomal sulfite detoxification solves the problem of having two counteracting pathways in the same cell compartment |CITS: [16307306]|.
/
/In contrast to its animal counterpart SO lacks the heme domain, hence being the only known Mo enzyme that possesses no other redox-active centers |CITS: [11598126]|. It has been demonstrated that the reaction catalyzed by sulfite oxidase involves the conversion of molecular oxygen into hydrogen peroxide |CITS: [16407262]|.
/
/While sulfite produced during the process of sulfate assimilation is fast converted into sulfide, SO has been discussed to serve as 'safety valve' to detoxify increased levels of sulfite |CITS: [16307306]| which would be harmful to plants. Under such conditions (high sulfite concentration) the catalase in the peroxisomes is inhibited and excess hydrogen peroxide adds sulfite oxidizing capacities in a non-enzymatically way, hence very likely both enzymatic and non-enzymatic steps are involved in the sulfite oxidation in plants |CITS: [16407262]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Starch and glycogen, megadalton-sized glucose polymers, are the major reservoir of readily available
/energy and carbon compounds in most living organisms, ranging from archaea, eubacteria and yeasts,
/up to higher eukaryotes including plants and animals |CITS: [20192737][21185717]|. Only parasites seem to lack enzymes
/for the metabolism of these compounds  |CITS: [12175798]|.
/
/The structure of |FRAME: Starch| in higher plants differs from that of its counterpart |FRAME: Glycogens| in animals and bacteria. |FRAME: Starch Starch| is a complex &alpha;-glucan that can be very difficult to adequately describe. |FRAME: Starch Starch| contains at least two different major sub-classes of &alpha;-glucans: |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses amylose| and |FRAME: CPD-7043|. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses Amylose| contains up to several thousand &alpha;-glucosyl units linked almost exclusively in &alpha;(1->4) linkage with very few branches of &alpha;(1->6) linkage.
/ |FRAME: CPD-7043 Amylopectin|, on the other hand is a much more branched
/molecule with many &alpha;(1->6) linkages and contains up to several million glucosyl residues. At least twelve different types of starch with different branching patterns and chain lengths have been reported |CITS: [ROBYT13]|. To further complicate the situation, |FRAME: Starch starch| can appears in different crystalline and soluble forms which are difficult to define and depict using standard chemical structures.
/
/It has been reported that cyanobacteria synthesize glycogen while red algae produce floridean-starch with structure that is intermediate between starch and glycogen, and that green algae accumulate amylopectin-like polysaccharides. However, some cyanobacteria (classified into group 5 by Honda et al |CITS: [10229577]| have distinct &alpha;-polyglucans (which were designated as semi-amylopectin), making them a transition point between glycogen and starch biosynthesis |CITS: [Wing-Ming94][15695453]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: Starch Starch| is synthesized in plastids, including chloroplasts in photosynthetic tissues and amyloplasts in
/non-photosynthetic tissues such as seeds, roots, and tubers. Starch synthesized in
/chloroplasts of photosynthetic tissues is degraded to maltose and glucose during the dark period (see |FRAME: PWY-6724|).
/These sugars are exported to the cytosol and used in |FRAME: PWY-7238 sucrose synthesis|.
/Sucrose can be readily transported to non-photosynthetic tissues to support plant growth or for starch synthesis in amyloplasts.
/
/The |FRAME: Starch|  biosynthesis pathway depicted here includes both chloroplast and amyloplast pathways.
/The starting point for the chloroplast pathway is fructose-6-phosphate, a product of photosynthetic carbon
/fixation. The starting point for amyloplast pathway is glucose-1-phosphate, a product of sucrose
/degradation. Studies from potato, pea, and maize indicate that glucose-6-phosphate, in addition to
/glucose-1-phosphate, can be imported into the amyloplast and can serve as the starting point for
/starch biosynthesis |CITS: [10929100]|.
/
/The role of plastidial &alpha;-phosphorylase enzymes (|FRAME: RXN-1826 2.4.1.1)| in starch biosynthesis remain controversial and may differ between species |CITS: [23393426][BALL09]|. For example, mutations in the |FRAME: AT3G29320| gene of Arabidopsis have no effect on starch biosynthesis |CITS: 15173560|.
/
/Following the initial production of |FRAME: ADP-D-GLUCOSE|, |FRAME:Starch| biosynthesis appears to involve reactions catalyzed by at least three classes of enzymes, i.e. starch synthases, starch branching enzymes and
/starch debranching enzymes |CITS: [BALL09]|. However, the exact steps involved and the order in which they are required for the formation of different types of starch may differ between species and even between different types of cells within the same species |CITS: [15743447]|. 
/
/There is also evidence that |FRAME: TAX-3055| might involve an additional enzyme in |FRAME:PWY-622|, namely, a disproportionating enzyme, |FRAME: GIO2-442|. However the corresponding enzyme, |FRAME: AT5G64860-MONOMER DPE1| in Arabidopsis has been shown to play a part in |FRAME: PWY-6427 starch degradation| instead |CITS: [BALL09][23393426]|.
/
/Developing a better understanding of starch biosynthesis and its regulation is an active area of research.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/ Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate (hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate) in plant cells.  Phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth.  It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|.  Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|.  Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|).  The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties.  Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract.  Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption.  Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|.  The degradation of phytate is achieved by a group of enzymes called phytases which have been mostly studied in microorganisms and plants.  Phytases belong to a special class of phosphomonoesterases and are capable of initiating the stepwise release of phosphate from phytate.  Phytases are used to reduce the level of phosphate pollution in areas of intensive animal production.  Addition of adequate amounts of microbial phytases in animal feed improves the utilization of phosphate from phytate, allowing for a reduction in inorganic phosphate supplementation in the diets for simple-stomached animals.  As a result, the fecal phosphate excretion of these animals may be reduced by up to 50%.  Finally, phytases can improve the nutritional value of plant-based foods (especially grains) by increasing the availability of the minerals chelated in phytin.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>  The degradation of phytate into <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate intermediates and, finally, <i>myo</i>-inositol, is performed by phytases which catalyze the removal of all the phosphate residues of the phytate molecule in a sequential order.  Each <i>myo</i>-inositol intermediate is released from the enzyme and may become a substrate for further hydrolysis |CITS:[12405789]|.  To date two main types of phytases have been described: 3-phytases (<i>myo</i>-inositol hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate 3-phosphorylase, EC 3.1.3.8) and 4-phytases (<i>myo</i>-inositol hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate 6-phosphorylase, EC 3.1.3.26), which lead to the production of 
/Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P<sub>5</sub> and Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P<sub>5</sub>, respectively, from phytate.  The main phytate degradation route elucidated in legumes, cereals, |FRAME:TAX-4932| and |FRAME:TAX-286|, then, goes from the conversion of either of these two compounds to Ins(1,2,5,6)P<sub>4</sub>, Ins(1,2,6)P<sub>3</sub> and Ins(1,2)P<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[12405789]|.  A minor route proceeds through the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P<sub>5</sub> to Ins(1,2,3,6)P<sub>4</sub>.  This minor branch results from lesser activities from the same enzymes involved in the catalysis of the reaction of the main branch, rather than that of the activity of a different set of enzymes |CITS:[12405789],[10879469]|.
/
/<b>Note on Inositol Phosphates:</b>  Inositol phosphates containing the (1,2,3)-trisphosphate cluster are iron-binding antioxidants |CITS:[9034232],[spiers95]|, and Ins(1,2,3,6)P<sub>4</sub> has a structure that is moderately effective in opening calcium channels  |CITS:[9160166],[8141257]|.  In addition, Ins(1,2,6)P<sub>3</sub> has anti-inflammatory and antisecretory properties |CITS:[claxon90]|.

/
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is synthesized from and degraded to |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, an
/intermediate of the |FRAME: TCA|, by a reversible transamination reaction with |FRAME: GLT| (for the

/This pathway is common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and provides a link between amino acid
/and carbohydrate metabolism.
/
/|FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|, which is consumed in this pathway, is replenished from the |FRAME:TCA|

/
/In |FRAME: TAX-83333| the |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|, encoded by the |FRAME: EG10096|

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General background</b>
/
/The amino acid glutamine is a constituent of proteins and a nitrogen donor for many biosynthetic reactions, including the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, glucosamime and carbamoyl phosphate. The biosynthesis of glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism found in all domains of life.  Phylogenetic analysis of glutamine synthetase genes has suggested that they are among the oldest functioning genes in the history of evolution |CITS: [8096645]|. In microorganisms and plants, glutamine synthetase (also known as GS) has a role in ammonia assimilation in combination with glutamate synthase (glutamine: &alpha;-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, or GOGAT) as indicated by the pathway links and pathways |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3282|). This is known as the GS/GOGAT pathway |CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]|.  
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/Three types of glutamine synthetases have been described, differing in number of subunits. The active site residues of all three types are conserved. 
/
/Glutamine synthetase type I is found mostly in bacteria and archaea, including |FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| (reviewed in |CITS: [11585846]|).  It is a well-studied homododecamer built from two back-to-back hexameric rings.
/
/Glutamine synthetase type II is found mostly in eukaryotes and some soil bacteria, but it has also been described in the halophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2252| |CITS: [17020556][16884924]|. It is a homooctamer.
/
/Glutamine synthetase type III has been described in anaerobic bacteria (such as |FRAME: TAX-246199|) and cyanobacteria, and is generally a homohexamer |CITS: [16237031]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process, in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds |CITS: [Huxtable86]|.
/Sulfonated macromolecules such as |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans|, |FRAME: HEPARIN| or |FRAME:Glucosinolates| are involved in many important processes, such as cell adhesion, hemostasis, the viscoelastic properties of connective tissue, and plant defense mechanisms. The sulfonation of tyrosine residues has been established as a post-translational modification for many secretory and membrane proteins (see |FRAME: HS10030-MONOMER|) and sulfated versions of lipids such as sphingolipids and galactoglycerolipids are found in the brain, peripheral nerves, and reproductive
/tissues of mammals.
/In addition, sulfoconjugation is important in the biotransformation of many low molecular weight compounds such as neurotransmitters and hormones, including catecholamines, iodothyronines, and steroids, and in the production of plant secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates.
/Another role for sulfonation is the detoxification and removal of drugs and xenobiotics compounds |CITS: [9668121]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule |CITS: [13851709]|. In many organisms, including plants and mammals, |FRAME: PAPS| (PAPS) is used as the universal sulfonate donor for all sulfotransferase reactions  |CITS: [13575436][6107250]|.
/
/The activation of inorganic sulfate to form PAPS is achieved by the concerted action of two enzymes.
/The first step is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.4| (also known as ATP-sulfurylase) and involves the reaction of inorganic sulfate with ATP to form |FRAME: APS| (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). This enzyme has an unfavorable equilibrium (Keq ~ 10<sup>-7</sup> M) in the direction of APS formation, and it has been postulated that the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of PPi by a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase |CITS: [2821345]|. In |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was found that the enzymes couples the formation of APS to hydrolysis of GTP |CITS: [8117661]|.
/
/The second step is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.25|, and involves the reaction of APS with ATP to form PAPS and ADP.
/
/It should be mentioned that in plants most of the APS is used for biosynthesis of |FRAME: CYS| and |FRAME: MET| via the further reduction of APS to sulfide (see |FRAME:SULFMETII-PWY|). In mammals, however, all of the APS is converted to PAPS and used for sulfonation.
/
/In bacteria, fungi, yeast and plants the two enzymes are found as separate polypeptide chains. In mammals the enzymes are physically linked on a single bifunctional protein |CITS: [8180221]|.
/
/For an extensive list of sulfonation reactions using |FRAME:PAPS|, please look at that compound's page.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC - this pathway), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the pathway illustrated here, |FRAME: PYRUVATE| is converted to |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|, a key reaction of central metabolism, which links the substrate-level phosphorylation pathway |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| (which ends with the generation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) to the |FRAME: TCA|, which accepts the input of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|.
/
/The |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX|, which in |FRAME:TAX-562| consists of 24 E1 subunits, 24 E2 subunits, and 12 E3 subunits, catalyzes three reactions that constitute a cycle.  The three reactions can be summarized by the reaction
/
/|FRAME:PYRUVDEH-RXN|.
/
/During aerobic growth of |FRAME:TAX-562| the cycle is an essential source of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to feed the |FRAME: TCA| and thereby to satisfy the cellular requirements for the precursor metabolites it forms. Mutant strains defective in the complex require an exogenous source of |FRAME: ACET| during aerobic growth, but not under anaerobic conditions,since during anaerobic growth pyruvate formate lyase generates |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| from |FRAME: PYRUVATE|.  Mutant strains lacking pyruvate formate lyase have the reverse phenotype |CITS: [ecosal]|.
/
/In some strains of |FRAME: TAX-2104| the multienzyme complex reaction is part of an alternate path from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate |CITS: [8948633] [9439886][3141576]|.
/
/Plants have two forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, one in the plastid and the other in the mitochondrion. The two complexes have distinct physiological roles. The plastid pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides the main acetyl-CoA source for <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-4381|). The mitochondrial complex provides acetyl-CoA 
/for the |FRAME: TCA| cycle and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Both complexes are feedback inhibited by acetyl-CoA and NADH. However the two complexes differ in other aspects of enzyme characteristics. The mitochondrial complex but not the plastid one is regulated by phosphorylation. The plastid complex requires higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and more alkaline pH for maximal enzyme activity |CITS: [12631264]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME:PWY-7220| and |FRAME:PWY-7222|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The salvage of purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleotides is common, but not universal. For example, the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have the enzymes that phosphorylate purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleoside monophopsphates, and thus is not able to utilize this salvage pathway.
/
/Mammalian cells contain four principal nucleoside kinase salvage enzymes, namely deoxycytidine kinase (|FRAME: HS08100|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "EC 2.7.1.74"|), thymidine kinases 1 and 2 (|FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "EC 2.7.1.21"|), and deoxyguanosine kinase (|FRAME: HS03819|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.113 "EC 2.7.1.113"|). In addition, adenosine kinase (|FRAME: HS08097|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.20 "EC 2.7.1.20"|) should also be considered a deoxyribonucleoside salvage enzyme, because it is can phosphorylate |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE|, although with much lower efficiency that the other enzymes |CITS: [7494863]|.
/
/The phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in mammalian cells is mediated predominantly by two of these enzymes, the cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (|FRAME: HS08100|) and the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (|FRAME: HS03819|). The |FRAME: CPLX-8620| is responsible for phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. It phosphorylate |FRAME: DEOXYGUANOSINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYINOSINE| with high affinity (Km < 25 &mu;M) and |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE| with lower affinity (Km > 60 &mu;M) |CITS: [6295492]|.
/
/Despite of its name, |FRAME: CPLX-8618| catalyzes the phosphorylation of not only |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| but also |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYGUANOSINE| |CITS: [3030413][7494863]|.
/The enzyme can utilize either ATP or UTP as phosphoryl donors, and based on comparison of <i>in vitro</i> kinetic data of |FRAME: CPD-15099| phosphorylation by both compounds it has been suggested that UTP is the <i>in vivo</i> relevant donor |CITS: [2021937][1406603]|.
/
/While there do not appear to exist dedicated enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the diphosphate form, the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of ribonucleoside monophosphates, namely adenylate kinase (|FRAME: EC-2.7.4.3 "EC 2.7.4.3"|) and guanylate kinase (|FRAME: EC-2.7.4.8 "EC 2.7.4.8"|), appear to also catalyze the reaction with the deoxynucleotides in all species studied so far |CITS: [11008000]|.
/
/Once the diphosphate forms are generated, they are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"| |CITS: [1659321][12009894]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Tryptophan biosynthesis in microbes involves five enzymes, encoded by 7 genes. The genes (trpA,B,C,D,E,F) 
/are usually arranged in a single cluster |CITS: [2679363]|, and form an operon whose transcription 
/is negatively regulated by tryptophan |CITS: [7007895]|. Additional regulation mechanisms exist at the translational and 
/post-translational levels, presumably because tryptophan synthesis is very expensive (78 mol ATP for each mol
/of tryptophan produced).
/In addition, hyperthermophilic organisms usually have an additional gene, trpB2, which is located outside of the 
/tryptophan operon. This gene encodes an additional enzyme which is similar to a subunit of tryptophan synthase.
/
/The two last steps in this pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, tryptophan synthase, which
/is composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits (E.C. reaction 4.2.1.20). 
/However, it has been shown that each of the subunits is responsible for catalyzing an individual step, and is able 
/to catalyze that step on its own. Thus, the activity of tryptophan synthase was divided into 
/two individual steps in the pathway, each catalyzed by the corresponding subunit.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In eukaryotes, L-alanine is degraded through transamination to pyruvate by alanine aminotransferase.  Pyruvate is 
/transported into the mitochondrion where it is oxidatively decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 
/to carbon dioxide and acetyl-CoA (as shown in the pathway link).  Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle .
/
/Biosynthetically, pyruvate is involved in gluconeogenesis (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY|) 
/and is also a precursor of the pyruvate family of amino acids:  alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine.
/In plants and bacteria, it is also a precursor of isoprenoids (see MetaCyc pathway
/|FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|).  
/
/Alanine aminotransferase is a commonly used diagnostic marker in humans.  It is produced mainly in the 
/liver and its presence in serum is an indicator of liver disease |CITS: [1992953]|.  The enzyme is present as 
/isozymes in both the cytosol and mitochondrion.  Expression of the isozymes varies among tissues and is 
/species-specific (in |CITS: [16495081]|).   
/
/In bacteria, alanine is converted to pyruvate by oxidative deamination (|CITS: [Gottschalk1986]|) 
/(see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY1-2|).  An alanine aminotransferase has been identified in the 
/archaeon |FRAME:TAX-2261| and is thought to function biosynthetically, transaminating pyruvate with 
/glutamate |CITS: [10762259]| (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5096|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC - this pathway), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In eukaryotes the mitochondrial glycine cleavage complex (glycine decarboxylase complex) is a loosely-associated multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of glycine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and a methylene group, in a multistep reaction (in |CITS: [15791207]|).  The methylene group, carried by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF|, enters cellular one-carbon metabolism. In mammals, it is the primary pathway for glycine catabolism |CITS: [6402507]|.
/
/The glycine cleavage complex is composed of four different proteins: the P-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.4.4.2|); the T-protein (|FRAME: EC-2.1.2.10|); the L-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.8.1.4|); and the H-protein (lipoyl-carrier protein, a non-enzyme that contains a lipoyl group that interacts successively with the three other components of the complex during the enzymatic reactions.
/The L-protein (also known as the E3 component) also participates in the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|, the |FRAME: PWY-5084|, and the |FRAME: PWY-5046| multienzyme systems.
/
/In plants, this complex is known as the |FRAME: GLYCINEDECARBOXYLASE| complex and functions in |FRAME: PWY-181 photorespiration|. Its components from the mitochondria of |FRAME:TAX-3888| (pea) leaf have been extensively studied |CITS: [3080433]| and reviewed in |CITS: [11286922]|. In vertebrates, the components of the |FRAME: CPLX-7302| from |FRAME:TAX-9031| (chicken) have been well studied |CITS: [1993704][1526969][1993703]|.   
/
/The glycine cleavage complex is also present in bacteria as shown here for the |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GCVMULTI-CPLX| |CITS: [11495998]|. In addition, components of the glycine cleavage complex have been characterized in archaea including the T-protein from |FRAME:TAX-53953| |CITS: [15272174]| and the L-protein from halophilic archaebacteria |CITS: [6426463] [8655478]| (although the role of the L-protein in glycine metabolism in halophiles is unclear |CITS: [8655478]|). In yeast, studies have been done on the regulation of genes encoding components of the glycine cleavage complex |CITS: [12702322]|.
/
/In humans, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia results from deficiency-causing mutations in the genes encoding P-protein, or T-protein. This autosomal recessively inherited disorder results in accumulation of large amounts of glycine in body fluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, causing severe neurological symptoms |CITS: [16450403]| and in |CITS: [16051266]|.  Mutations in gene DLD that encodes L-protein can result in lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, a disease with multiple physiological symptoms and significant morbidity |CITS: [9934985]|.
/
/Crystal structures of the components of the glycine cleavage complex have been determined from plant, animal, and bacterial sources. References include: P-protein |CITS: [15791207]|, T-protein |CITS: [15272174] [16051266]|, L-protein |CITS: [10806386]|, and H-protein |CITS: [10806386]|. 
/
/The reactions of the glycine cleavage complex are reversible, and also provide a route for glycine biosynthesis (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: GLYCINE-SYN2-PWY|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain the redox balance, keeping a
/reduced environment (see the pathway |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|), they fight reactive oxygen and
/nitrogen species, and they are involved in the detoxification of many other toxins and stress-inducing
/factors.
/
/In most organisms the major thiol is the tripeptide |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly,
/known as GSH). The intracellular concentration of GSH ranges from 0.5-10 mM.
/Most of the non-protein cysteine is stored in the form of GSH, since free |FRAME: CYS| auto-oxidizes
/rapidly to |FRAME: CYSTINE|, producing potentially toxic oxygen radicals |CITS: [11544348]|. 
/
/In the process of reducing other molecules (such as peroxides) two molecules of GSH are condensed
/into a single molecule of the oxidized form glutathione disulfide (see |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|).
/In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (for example,
/see |FRAME: CPLX-5881|). Recently, glutathione-dependent peroxidases have been discovered in
/several prokaryotes as well |CITS: [11399772] [12606554]|.
/The disulfide is reduced back to GSH by the action of |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. Most of
/the glutathione pool is kept in the reduced form. In |FRAME:TAX-562|, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione is 200:1
/|CITS: [11544348]|.
/
/GSH is active against toxins by a process that involves multiple enzyme, and in the case of eukaryotes, occurs
/across multiple organs.
/Toxins are conjugated to GSH by a dedicated enzyme, resulting in a cysteine-toxin conjugate (this occurs in the liver
/in eukaryotes). The conjugate is acetylated (in the kidney), and cleaved, resulting in a part of the
/glutatione molecule and a mercapturate form of the toxin, which is excreted out of the cell 
/(see |FRAME: PWY-4061|) |CITS: [8145281]|.
/
/In addition, low molecular weight thiols have been found to be involved in a few other cellular process, including
/DNA synthesis |CITS: [1970635]| and formaldehyde reduction (see |FRAME: PWY-1801| |CITS: [Patel98]|.
/
/While GSH is the major thiol in eukaryotic organisms, Gram negative bacteria and the majority of Gram positive
/bacteria, it is not universal. In some organisms other thiols have taken its role, including |FRAME: CoM|,
/|FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, ergothioneine, |FRAME: CPD1G-2| and the ovothiols. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In mammals, the intracellular synthesis of glutathione and its utilization are linked by the
/&gamma;-glutamyl cycle, which is composed of six enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
/The first two reactions are responsible for GSH biosynthesis - in the first step, which is catalyzed by
/|FRAME: CPLX66-16|, an amide linkage is formed between |FRAME:CYS| and |FRAME: GLT|.
/|FRAME: CPLX-5961| then catalyzes the reaction between |FRAME:GLY| and the cysteine carboxyl
/of the |FRAME: L-GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE| dipeptide to form GSH.
/
/The second part of the pathway consists of glutathione degradation, and occurs outside of the cell.
/The enzymes that catalyze its breakdown are |FRAME: CPLX-6041| and different dipeptidases,
/which are membrane-bound proteins located predominantly on the apical surface of epithelial tissues
/in mammals. |FRAME: CPLX-6041| is the only enzyme that can remove the
/&gamma;-glutamyl moiety from GSH under physiological conditions, while the dipeptidases
/(EC 3.4.11.2) remove the glycyl moiety. The breakdown products (glutamate, glycine,
/and cysteine) can be reabsorbed into the cell and used for additional GSH synthesis (by EC 6.3.22 and
/EC 6.3.2.3) |CITS: [9027][9755286]|.

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the common aerobic route for |FRAME: Heme-b| biosynthesis. This pathway involves the enzymes |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| and |FRAME: MONOMER-17460|, which require moelecular oxygen for their respective reactions.
/
/There are several types of protoporphyrinogen oxidases: in most eukaryotes and many aerobic or facultative bacteria, such as Firmicutes, the enzyme is a FAD-dependent ~55 kDa protein encoded by the |FRAME: BSU10140| gene. A number of &gamma;-proteobacteria, including |FRAME:TAX-562|, have another type of oxidase, a 21 kDa protein encoded by the |FRAME: EG11485| gene.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This pathway shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens the chain of an acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] molecule by two carbons. The pathway is fed acetoacetyl-[acp] (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|), which  is a substrate of the second reaction shown here.
/
/The products of multiple turns of this cycle are drawn off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds, such as phospholipids, lipid A, and lipoproteins. They comprise saturated fatty acids such as |FRAME: DODECANOATE| (dodecanoate), |FRAME: CPD-7836| (tetradecanoate), |FRAME: PALMITATE| (hexadecanoate), and |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| (octadecanoate).
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-562|, of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These function preferentially on substrates of different chain length. They also act differentially on saturated and unsaturated substrates |CITS: [8910376]|.
/
/The first reaction in the sequence, the condensation reaction, is catalyzed in |FRAME:TAX-562| by three enzymes, FabB, FabF, and FabH. However, FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-[acp] as a substrate, and is thus not included in this pathway (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) |CITS: [14523010]|. Other organisms may use other initiation enzymes, such as |FRAME: G-15300 FabY|.

/Bacteria such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562| </i> also contain unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed by a pathway that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate (see |FRAME:PWY0-862|) |CITS: [14527277][8246839]|.
/FabB, but not FabF, participates in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|. The activity of FabF, and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are saturated, is modultated by temperature. However, the distribution of the flow of synthesis that proceeds to saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids is determined mostly by the activities of FabA and FabZ |CITS: [8910376]|.
/
/The final step of the cycle, the reductase, is known to be catalzed by enzymes that utilize either NADH, or NADPH, or both |CITS: [9022698]|. The |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: EG11528 FabI| can use both cofactors, although the activity with NADH was shown to be over 17-fold higher than with NADPH |CITS: [9022698]|. |FRAME: G-15301 FabV| and |FRAME: G-15302 FabK| are NADH-specific. FabV enzymes are common in Gram-negative bacteria, and have been described from multiple organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-208964| |CITS: [19933806]|, |FRAME: TAX-13373| |CITS: [20055482]|, |FRAME: TAX-347| |CITS: [22039545]|, |FRAME: TAX-668| |CITS: [22232178]|, and |FRAME: TAX-632| |CITS: [22244758]|. FabK enzymes are found only in some Gram-positive bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-1313| |CITS: [10910344][12487627]| and |FRAME: TAX-837| |CITS: [22820244]|. Another isoform, |FRAME: BSU08650 FabL|, which is found in |FRAME: TAX-1423| and some other Gram-positive bacteria, uses only NADPH |CITS: [11007778]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The genes necessary for histidine biosynthesis have been identified in many bacteria, fungi, plants,
/and archaea. The pathway in all of these organisms is identical, with small differences in some of
/the enzymes used. Histidine is an essential amino acid, and is not synthesized by mammals.
/
/A few differences between different organisms concern whether the enzymes are mono- or bifunctional. One such case is the enzyme histidinol-phosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.15). Some organisms, including  |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: TAX-90371| and |FRAME: TAX-727|, have a bifunctional enzyme, with the C-terminal domain exhibiting |FRAME:IMIDPHOSDEHYD-ENZRXN| (EC 4.2.1.19) activity. These enzymes belong to the DDDD phosphohydrolase/phosphotransferase superfamily. Other organisms have separate monofunctional enzymes catalyzing
/these two reactions. Monofunctional histidinol-phosphate phosphatases belong to either the PHP (polymerase and histidinol phosphatase) superfamily, as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-1423|, |FRAME: TAX-4932| and |FRAME: TAX-300852| |CITS: [14993698]|, or to the DDDD superfamily, as in the case of the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-342948| NA1 |CITS: [18223080]|.
/
/Another such case concerns the conversion of |FRAME:PHOSPHORIBULOSYL-FORMIMINO-AICAR-P| (BBM III) to |FRAME:D-ERYTHRO-IMIDAZOLE-GLYCEROL-P| (IGP) and |FRAME:AICAR| (AICAR). This process requires two catalytic functions, including the transfer of an amide from |FRAME: GLN| and a cyclization reaction. In prokaryotes, these two catalytic activities are encoded by two genes whose products form a complex. In yeast and plants, this conversion is catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme.
/
/In all organisms operating the pathway, the enzyme catalyzing the first step is feedback-inhibited  by |FRAME: HIS|. In plants, the entire pathway is located inside the chloroplast |CITS: [16547652]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Yeast cells contain 3 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate.  Two pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 |CITS: [2989290]||CITS: [9287019]|.  The third pathway is driven by the combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, encoded by GLN1 and GLT1, respectively |CITS: [2570348]||CITS: [8923741]|.  Gln1p catalyzes amination of glutamate to form glutamine; Glt1p then transfers the amide group of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate, generating two molecules of glutamate.  Glutamate synthase, also referred to as GOGAT, is a trimer of three Glt1p subunits.  Expression of the GLT1 gene is modulated by glutamate-mediated repression and by Gln3p/Gcn4p-mediated activation, depending upon the availability of nitrogen and glutamate in the medium.  In amino acid starvation conditions, GLT1 expression is activated to a moderate degree by Gcn4p |CITS: [9657994]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are |FRAME: Nitrogen-Fixation "nitrogen fixation"|, |FRAME: PWY-381 "nitrate assimilation"|, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by |FRAME: PWY-181|, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms. The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-6964|). 
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor. However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be |FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal acceptor, which could be oxygen in the case of aerobic respiration, or another type of molecule in anaerobic respiration. 
/
/Known terminal acceptors include organic compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|), or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|, |FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|, |FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold, |FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the membrane due to three potential processes:
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit |FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The alternative terminal oxidase pathway is found in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of plants (also known as the electron transport chain, or ETC), as well as some fungi and protists |CITS:[9349280][9426242][12228600][10981696][11405094]|, but is absent from animal mitochondria.
/Unlike the cytochrome respiratory pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-3781|), the alternative pathway is not coupled to synthesis of ATP and is not inhibited by cyanide. It is however inhibited by substituted hydroxamic acids such as |FRAME:CPD-6543| (SHAM) and |FRAME:CPD-6542|.
/
/Alternative oxidase (AOX) activity was first described as oxygen consumption in the presence of cyanide from the study of lily pollen and was later found in high levels in the thermogenic inflorescences of the unusual group of plants belonging to the family Araceae. In this family AOX allows rapid, uncoupled respiration, leading to a characteristic heating of the inflorescence |CITS:[meeuse]|. This process, also known as thermogenesis, uses the heat produced during flowering to volatize a compound that attracts pollinating insects. In other, more typical plant species, AOX activity has been proposed to be involved in response to oxidative stress |CITS:[moller01]|. There, AOX would be used to minimize the formation of reactive oxygen species by preventing the overreduction of the ETC.
/
/The pathway has drawn special interest as a target for anti-parasite therapeutics since it was shown to play a key role in the respiration of the trypanosome, better known as the causative agent of African sleeping sickness |CITS:[7581322]|. The alternative pathway branches from the cytochrome pathway in the inner mitochondrial membrane at the ubiquinone pool and passes electrons to a single terminal oxidase, the alternative oxidase. This protein reduces molecular oxygen to water in a single four-electron transfer step. The electron transport through the alternative oxidase from ubiquinone to water does not contribute to the transmembrane potential and wastes two of the three coupling sites that are part of the cytochrome pathway. Some energy production is nevertheless achieved through the phosphorylating potential of NADH dehydrogenase (|FRAME:CPLX-5263|) |CITS:[15012279]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In this pathway |FRAME: SUCROSE| is cleaved by invertase (|FRAME: EC-3.2.1.26|). This enzyme acts on &beta;-D-fructofuranosides, releasing |FRAME: BETA-D-FRUCTOSE|. When acting on sucrose, the products are |FRAME: BETA-D-FRUCTOSE| and |FRAME: Glucopyranose|.

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698179970:bxue
COMMENT - Phospholipids are the major structural components of biological membranes in plants, animals, and yeasts. In plants, phospholipids predominate extra-chloroplast membranes including the plasma membrane, mitochondria membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal membrane, with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine being the major constituents. Phospholipids are mostly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once synthesized, they are transported to other phospholipid containing membranes.
/
/At least three different pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE| in plants:
/The decarboxylation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5669|), the |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| transfer pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-6|), and the base (head group) exchange pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6273|). The phosphoethanolamine transfer pathway (this one) is believed to be the major pathway in plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, sugar and amino sugar residues are converted to sugar nucleotides prior to their incorporation into structural polysaccharides via UDP-sugar transferases. In this pathway, UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is the amino sugar nucleotide donor of <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues for the biosynthesis of glycosylated proteins and cell surface structures.  Two variations of this pathway exist, one in eukaryotes and one in prokaryotes.  In the eukaryotic pathway shown here, fructose-6-phosphate produced during
/glycolysis (see pathway |FRAME: ANAGLYCOLYSIS-PWY|) is transaminated and isomerized to glucosamine-6-phosphate, followed by acetylation to <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, isomerization to <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate, and uridylation to UDP-GlcNAc. In prokaryotes, the first and last reactions are similar to those of eukaryotes, but in the second and third reactions, glucosamine-6-phosphate is isomerized to glucosamine-1-phosphate, followed by its <i>N</i> acetylation to <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate (see pathway |FRAME: UDPNAGSYN-PWY|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [16408321]|. 
/
/In eukaryotes this cytosolic pathway is highly regulated.  UDP-GlcNAc donates GlcNAc residues for the biosynthesis of several classes of compounds, including N-linked glycans (see pathway |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS|), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, glycolipids, and |FRAME:CHITIN|, a 
/homopolymer of GlcNac (in |CITS: [14555471]|).  This pathway has been well studied both genetically and biochemically in yeast.  The first committed, rate-limiting, step in hexosamine <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis is catalyzed by glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase).  It is essentially irreversible and is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, including feedback inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc (reviewed in |CITS: [16408321]|).  
/
/In some bacteria, some fungi (but not yeast), and metazoa, UDP-GlcNAc can be converted to UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-D-galactosamine by UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine 4-epimerase. <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-galactosamine is a component of several different kinds of cell surface structures and glycosylated proteins (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5512|).   A UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.14) produces UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine for N-glycosylated mannoprotein biosynthesis.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16408321]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Chlorophyll degradation, corresponding to the loss of green color, is an integral part of leaf senescence and fruit ripening |CITS:[16113212],[15012204],[10767575],[12675736]|.  Chlorophyll degradation may follow one of two routes, likely depending on the physiogical context in which it occurs. This pathway, |FRAME: PWY-6927|, begins in the chloroplast and may be the primary route for chlorophyll degradation in senescing leaves in |FRAME: ORG-5993| and other species, such as broccoli (|FRAME: TAX-3712|) |CITS: [19304936][20727617]|. Meanwhile, the |FRAME: PWY-5098| pathway may be cytosolic and may operate during fruit senescence and in response to pathogens and wounding |CITS: [15598807][18633118]|.
/
/Both of these pathways appear to lead to the production of a colourless, blue-fluorescing intermediate (primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite or pFCC) <i>via</i> the formation of a red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC).  Following export of pFCC from the chloroplast, the final steps of chlorophyll catabolism are species-specific and involve a diversity of modifications of pFCC before the catabolites are finally stored in the vacuole in the form of |FRAME:NCCS|, or NCCs |CITS:[15012204],[16448336]|.  NCCs share a common tetrapyrrolic skeleton with an oxygenolytically opened porphyrin macrocycle |CITS:[KRAEUTER03]|, with peripheral, species-specific modification at several side chains within different NCCs.  The final conversion of modified FCCs to NCCs is a non-enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the acidic vacuolar pH.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this route of chlorophyll degradation, the magnesium is removed from chlorophyll a prior to the dephytylation step. The first enzyme in this pathway has not been discovered to date, but the |FRAME: AT5G13800-MONOMER pheophyinase| (PPH) enzyme catalyzing the second reaction in |FRAME: ORG-5993| has been identified and characterized |CITS: [19304936]|. Evidence for this alternative route was collected after it was observed that the two chlorophyllases that catalyze the first step of the |FRAME: PWY-5098| variant pathway are not required for chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence in |FRAME: ORG-5993| |CITS: [17996203]|. It was also noted that PPH transcript levels are upregulated in senescing Arabidopsis leaves |CITS: [19304936]|.
/
/The next two steps, which are shared by both variant pathways, are decisive in the loss of green colour.  The ring-opening of, and production of the first identifiable colourless product pFCC from pheophorbide <i>a</i> requires two proteins from gerontoplasts membranes and stroma.  Opening of the ring through oxygenolysis of pheophorbide <i>a</i> is catalyzed by the membrane-localized,  nonheme iron-containing monooxygenase, pheophorbide <i>a</i> oxygenase (PaO) which yields red bilin RCC.  This compound is channeled to RCCR which further reduces it to form pFCC.  Both enzymes use reduced ferredoxin as immediate electron donor |CITS:[15012204]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General background</b>
/
/Maintenance of genomic and transcriptomic integrity is a vital goal of all organisms. Cells are often subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as |FRAME: CPD-12377|,  that can arise from due to oxidative stress, ionizing radiation, and certain aspects of normal cellular metabolism. These ROS can modify nucletide bases and cause problems during DNA replication and RNA transcription. This damage can occur on free nucleotides or in the context of DNA or RNA macromolecules. Organisms have evolved several strategies for trying to combat the damage that can be caused by oxidative stress, including this pathway that is involved in eliminating a source of potentially mutagenic nucleotides before they can be used for DNA replication or mRNA transcription |CITS: [ROGACHEVA08]|.
/
/Oxidation of the free |FRAME: GTP| and |FRAME: DGTP| can occur spontaneously in cells when a hydroxyl radical attacks the C8 position of the purine base guanine |CITS: [16863995]|. If the |FRAME: CPD0-1905| is incorporated into DNA, it can pair with a C or an A and lead to G:C ->T:A or A:T -> C:G transversions respectively,  although the A:T to C:G transversion seems to be more common <i>in vivo</i> (|CITS: [1309939] [ROGACHEVA08]|). Similarly, an |FRAME: CPD-12366| can be incorrectly incorporated opposite an adenosine residue during RNA transcription |CITS: [17804481]|. To prevent these errors, a Nudix hydrolase acts to remove a pyrophophate group from the oxidized nucelotides, thus, rendering them incompetent for incorporation into DNA or RNA |CITS: [ROGACHEVA08]|. It is important to note that there is evidence from humans that |FRAME: CPD-12365| cannot be re-phosphorylated by the guanylate kinase enzyme |CITS: [7819228]|. 
/
/Oxidized (d)GTP appears to be a potentially major source of genetic lesions. Both mutant <i>E.coli</i> and eukaryotes show marked increases in DNA and RNA errors when this pathway is blocked . And the errors caused by the failure of this pathway may be linked to cancer and other DNA-damage related diseases  |CITS: [1309939][17804481][ROGACHEVA08]|. 
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/The ROS-induced steps shown in this pathway occur spontaneously. The subsequent de-toxification of the damaged free nucleotides is carried out by the members of the Nudix family of hydrolases. MutT from E.coli was the first characterized protein shown to have this protective pyrophosphatase activity |CITS: [9311918]|. Homologs of this protein have been functionally characterized in species as distantly related as humans |CITS: [1332067]|, the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [15475388]| , and Arabidopsis plants |CITS: [15878881][17804481]| suggesting that this is a widely conserved pathway for preventing genomic and transcriptomic errors in the presence of ROS.
/
/In humans, |FRAME: CPD-12365 "8-oxo-dGMP"| is further degraded to |FRAME: CPD-12381| which can exit through the cell membrane, and end up in the urine where it is used as a diagnostic measurement of oxidative stress |CITS: [7819228]|. It is unclear what downstream steps are used to remove or recycle |FRAME: CPD-12367 "8-oxo-GMP"| or |FRAME: CPD-12365 "8-oxo-dGMP"| in other organisms.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the degradation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The enzyme was reported in human, animal and some microbes. Deficiency of PAH in human is related to the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria. It is only very recent, through a phylogenetic and biochemical study, PAH was shown to present in nonflowering plants |CITS: [20959559]|. Still, there is no evidence for its presence in flowering plants |CITS: [20959559], [18245455]|. The cofactor for human PAH is tetrahydrobiopterin |CITS: [10727395]| which however does not exist in plants. In vitro assay of recombinant PAH from chlamydomonas or moss showed highest enzyme activity with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Thus 10-formyltetrahydrofolate is very likely to be the in vivo cofactor in plants |CITS: [20959559]|. PAH reaction converts the cofactor 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-4a-carbinolamine which needs to be recycled back to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Similar to the human pathway (see |FRAME: PHENYLALANINE-DEG1-PWY|), the cofactor regeneration in plants needs pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) and q-dihydropterin reductase (qDHPR). Plant PCD has been identified [18245455], but qDHPR remains to be unknown in plants. The qDHPR reaction seems unlikely to be mediated by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) because PAH and PCD are both plastidial yet DHFR is in mitochondria |CITS: [21275646]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|. They are also found in some non-photosynthetic bacteria, such as some strains of |FRAME: TAX-53335| and |FRAME: TAX-29| |CITS:[4340261][2254247][1946693]|. Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.
/These isoprenoids pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against 
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments; light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided in two major groups: carotenes and xanthophylls. Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene. Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy, keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein and zeaxanthin. The carotenoid composition varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly, developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210][8485401]|. Important carotenoids variations are observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|). Higher plant chloroplasts typically accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound photosystems |CITS:[1885603][Ryberg93]|. &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[Young93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found |CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin) |CITS:[1885603][8444169]|. In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/An important branch-point in the biosynthesis of carotenoids lies in the cyclization of the linear, pink |FRAME:CPD1F-114| into carotenes with all-&beta;-, all-&epsilon;- or mixed &beta; and &epsilon; rings. The cyclization reactions are catalyzed by lycopene &beta;- or &epsilon;-cyclases. These cyclases all share a conserved amino acid sequence signature and bind dinucleotides such as FAD and NADP |CITS:[8837512]|, but otherwise share little resemblance.
/
/A single cyclization performed by a |FRAME: MONOMER-12154| adds a &beta; ring at one end, resulting in |FRAME: CPD1F-126|. A second cyclization at the other end produces |FRAME: CPD1F-129|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CELLULOSE "Cellulose"| is the most abundant organic polymer found in nature. It is produced by plants, some animals, algae, fungi, flagellates and bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-28448|, |FRAME: TAX-358| and |FRAME: TAX-379| spp. |CITS: [2030672]|. Cellulose is an intrinsic structural component of plant primary and secondary cell walls, building a network with other carbohydrate polymers. Bacteria generally produce cellulose as an extracellular component for mechanical and chemical protection, but it can also be used to facilitate cell adhesion to host tissue |CITS: [7462151]|.
/Cellulose accounts for about 20% (by weight) of the plant primary cell walls, and about 50% of the secondary cell walls.
/
/The primary structure of cellulose is a linear array of D-glucose molecules joined by &beta; (1,4) glycosyl linkage. The biosynthesis of cellulose is catalyzed by the cellulose synthase enzyme complex which is visualized as rosettes located in the plasma membrane. It is proposed that each rosette is composed of six subunits, and each rosette subunit in turn is composed of 6 cellulose synthases. Each individual cellulose synthase catalyzes the formation of one glucan chain which then associates with neighbor chains of the same rosette to form cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [12514238]|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-3701| the substrate  for cellulose synthesis is UDP-glucose channeled from sucrose degradation. At least six cellulose synthase genes were shown to be required in cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis. |FRAME: G-1681|, 
/|FRAME: G-1682|, and |FRAME: G-1683| are involved in cellulose biosynthesis in the primary walls. |FRAME: G-1684|, |FRAME: G-1685|, and |FRAME: G-1686| are involved in cellulose synthesis in the secondary walls. Mutant and mutant complementation analysis indicate that these isoforms of cellulose synthase are not functionally redundant. 
/
/It was hypothesized that cellulose synthesis requires a primer, similar to glycogen biosynthesis. Recent work in cotton has shown that sitosterol-&beta;-glucose can serve as a primer. UDP-glucose can be used to form sterol cellodextrins from sitosterol-&beta;-glucose, presumably catalyzed by a cellulose synthase  |CITS: [11778054]|. 
/
/It has been shown that in addition to cellulose synthase |FRAME: MONOMER-2367| is also required in cellulose biosynthesis. It is possibly involved in trimming off defective glucans from the growing microfibrils, or cleaving off the sitosterol-&beta;-glucose primer from the growing glucan chains |CITS: [11351091]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: GAPOXNPHOSPHN-RXN "glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase"| slowly catalyzes the formation of a hydrated form of NADH, called |FRAME: NADHX|, from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible. In addition, NADHX can be formed spontaneously from NADH under slightly acidic conditions.
/
/NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. This is achieved by the enzyme |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER| which has been originally described from yeast |CITS: [Meinhart56]|. Upon identification of the yeast enzyme it was found that homologs are found in the overwhelming majority of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The human and yeast enzymes also accept (S)-NADPHX, with higher maximal activity |CITS: [21994945]|.
/
/Since both |FRAME: CPD0-2472| and |FRAME: CPD-653| are formed, but |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER| can only accept the <i>S</i>-form, the <i>R</i> form needs to be epimerized to the <i>S</i>-form before it can converted back to NADH. This is achieved by the enzyme |FRAME: ENSG00000163382-MONOMER| |CITS: [21994945]|. 
/
/While the two enzymes are encoded by two different genes in yeast and humans, in |FRAME:TAX-562| a single bifunctional protein (encoded by the |FRAME: EG11758 YjeF| gene) is responsible for catalyzing both reactions. However, that protein differs from the eukaryotic proteins by using ADP rather than ATP to drive the dehydration reaction |CITS: [21994945]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways thart enable them to rescue thiamin fragments obtained from the environment. This pathway describes the salvage of |FRAME: HMP| (HMP), a degradation product of thiamin that can be generated by |FRAME: BSU11650-MONOMER thiaminase| enzymes.
/
/The salvaged HMP is phosphorylated to form |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, which is incorporated into the <i>de novo</i> thiamin biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [18054064]|. In most cases the salvage reaction is catalyzed by the biosynthetic enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction, which is part of the <i>de novo</i> pathway.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This is an alternative degradation route of fatty acids with cis-double bonds on odd-number carbons, for example, oleate, that was proposed after the identification of a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase from yeast |CITS: [10455114]|. The physiological role of the yeast DCI1 however remains unclear since yeast mutants with a deletion in DCI1 showed no deficiency in utilization of oleate |CITS: [10455114]|. Later, this pathway was thought to be present in Arabidopsis based on the identification of the Arabidopsis DCI1 |CITS: [16040662], [17434787]|. No genetics data are available for the Arabidopsis DCI1 thus its physiological role in fatty acid degradation is still unclear.
/
/In this pathway, unsaturated fatty acids with cis-double bonds on odd-number carbons (i.e. a double bond on the 9th position in the case of oleate) are converted to cis-5-enoyl-CoA after two rounds of |FRAME: PWY-5136 "core beta oxidation cycle"|. Instead of continuing for another round of core beta-oxidation cycle which would yield cis-3-enoyl-CoA to enter |FRAME: PWY-5137|, cis-5-enoyl-CoA once being oxidized to trans-2,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA exits the core beta oxidation. It is converted to trans-3,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA by delta3,delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Trans-3,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA is then converted by the di-isomerase delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase to trans-2,trans-4-dienoyl-CoA. The latter is further converted to trans-3-enoyl-CoA by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. Finally, trans-3-enoyl-CoA is converted to trans-2-enoyl-CoA to reenter core beta oxidation for complete degradation.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: SQUALENE| is a naturally occurring polyprenyl compound primarily known for its key role as
/an intermediate in sterol biosynthesis. The name originates from the scientific name for the shark
/(|FRAME: TAX-7796| spp.), since shark liver oil is considered the richest source of squalene. However,
/squalene is abundant in many plant oils, including olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, amaranth oil, and
/rice bran oil.
/
/Squalene is structurally similar to |FRAME: CPD1F-129|, and is produced in two steps from two molecules
/of |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| which are joined and reduced by the enzyme
/|FRAME: AT4G34640-MONOMER|. After its biosynthesis, squalene can be transported to other areas
/of the body for incorporation into tissues (in humans, about 60 percent of dietary squalene is absorbed
/and transported in serum to be distributed ubiquitously in different tissues, with the greatest
/concentration in the skin |CITS: [9988781]|) or it can be further metabolized by the enzyme
/|FRAME: YGR175C-MONOMER|, generating |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE|.
/
/The fate of |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| is different in different organisms.
/In animals and fungi it is substrate for |FRAME: HS08480-MONOMER|, an enzyme that
/generates |FRAME: LANOSTEROL|, a main gateway for the synthesis of all other sterols in these
/organisms, including cholesterol (see |FRAME: PWY66-341|).
/In plants |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| is processed by |FRAME: AT2G07050-MONOMER|, which
/generates |FRAME: CYCLOARTENOL|. This compound is then converted to many different
/sterol compounds (see |FRAME: PWY-2541|).
/
/Squalenes appear to be very common in the Archaea. 
/A study of the lipid composition of the thermophilic chemolithotroph |FRAME: TAX-145262| showed
/that squalene was the major component of the non-polar lipids |CITS: [691077]|.
/Another study of the neutral lipids of nine species of methanogens found that squalene and/or hydrosqualene
/derivatives were the predominant components in eight of them |CITS: [458874]|.
/
/Sterol biosynthesis by eubacteria is very rare. However, steroid precursors including
/|FRAME: LANOSTEROL| and |FRAME: CYCLOARTENOL| were isolated from several prokaryotes,
/including |FRAME: TAX-41| |CITS: [12519197]|, |FRAME: TAX-54| |CITS: [Kohl83]|,

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|), fatty acid metabolism (via |FRAME:ACETONE|), and protein metabolism (via |FRAME:AMINO-ACETONE|). |FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review).
/There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/There are several pathways for the removal of methylglyoxal. In this pathway, methylglyoxal is reduced to acetol by the action of various enymes possessing |FRAME: G7558-MONOMER| activity. 
/Most of the enzymes that have been characterized with this activity belong to the family of NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). For example, the human aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) and aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) are both capable of reducing methylglyoxal to acetol |CITS: [1537826]|. Other mammalian AKRs that were shown to catalyze this reaction include AKR1, AKR1A, AKR1B1, AKR7, AKR7A2 and AKR7A5 |CITS: [16919][10510318][12123834][12604212]|.
/
/Several |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzymes homologous to the mammalian AKRs have also been shown to catalyze the same reaction |CITS: [9095467]|. Overexpression of the aldo-keto reductase AKR14A1, encoded by the |FRAME:G7558| gene, leads to increased resistance to methylglyoxal |CITS: [12583903]|. In addition, three other genes (|FRAME:G6967|, |FRAME:G7565|, and |FRAME:EG11648|) were shown to encode proteins with similar activities |CITS:[16077126]|.
/All four proteins were purified, and shown to catalyze the reaction in vitro, in the presence of NADPH. A similar enzyme has been identified in cyanobacteria |CITS: [16804176]|.
/
/A variation has been found in the Saccharomycete fungus |FRAME: TAX-1004253|, in which an NADH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase has been documented |CITS: [Inoue92]|.
/
/Prolonged incubations of |FRAME:TAX-562| cell-free extracts with methylglyoxal resulted in conversion of acetol to |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| |CITS: [16077126]|. The enzyme proposed to catalyze this reaction is |FRAME:GLYCDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [6183251][3920199]|. A similar conversion has been observed in other microorganisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-1517|
/|CITS: [Cameron86]|. In bacteria |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| is a dead-end metabolite and exits the cell rapidly |CITS: [2644239]|.
/
/The same reaction has also been observed in mammalian systems, where it is catalyzed by |FRAME: HS01502-MONOMER| |CITS: [1537826]|. In mammals |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| is metabolized in the liver to L-lactate |CITS: [1537826]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The glycolysis pathway represented here is also known as the '<i>Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway</i>'.  First identified in yeast cells and mammalian tissue, it is now also seen as the 'central' metabolic pathway in plants, and can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions: i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.  The ultimate purpose of the pathway is to convert carbon in its reduced form in storage carbohydrates (e.g. |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, |FRAME:Starch| and simpler carbohydrates such as |FRAME:SUCROSE|, |FRAME:D-Glucose| and |FRAME:D-Galactose|).  In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:TCA|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids.  In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621| and |FRAME: PWY-6724|, respectively.  Whereas the <i>plastidic</i> glycolysis pathway (see |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS|) is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis, the <i>cytosolic</i> pathway (i.e. this pathway) is slightly modified.  These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|.  In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues, the primary function of |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS| is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|.  In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE|.
/
/The pathway starts with |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, which is made available from a variety of sources (in the plant plastids, it results from |FRAME: PWY-6724|).  The first committed step of glycolysis is the reversible conversion of |FRAME:GLC-6-P| into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| by an hexose phosphate isomerase, which changes the pyranose configuration of glucose into the furanose configuration of fructose.  The second step is catalyzed by a phosphofructokinase in the presence of |FRAME:ATP|; this step is irreversible (in the cytosol of plants, see |FRAME:PWY-621|, an alternative enzyme uses |FRAME:PPI| instead of ATP).  The third step is catalyzed by an aldolase which cleaves |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| into interconvertable (they are keto-enol tautomers) two three-carbon fragments: |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|.  The interconversion of these tautomers is facilitated by a triose phosphate isomerase.  The following reaction, which adds one phosphate residue to |FRAME:GAP| to form |FRAME:DPG|, is freely reversible and requires |FRAME:NAD| and |FRAME:Pi|.  The next step releases one molecule of ATP during the conversion of |FRAME:DPG| into |FRAME:G3P| by a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate kinase.  The next step requires little energy change and leads to the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from the 3- to the 2-hydroxyl group of glycerate, leading to the formation of |FRAME:2-PG|.  The removal of a molecule of water by an enolase in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> converts |FRAME:2-PG| into |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|.  The final step of glycolysis involves the ketolization of |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| to |FRAME:PYRUVATE| by a pyruvate kinase, leading to the release of a molecule of ATP.
/
/In the cytosol, there are two alternative reactions to the plastidic pathway: EC 2.7.1.90 and EC 1.2.1.9.  The former represents an alternative to EC 2.7.1.11; this reaction utilizes |FRAME:PPI| rather than ATP to convert |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|.  The plant cytosol lacks soluble inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatases (PPiases) and, consequently, contains higher concentrations of |FRAME:PPI| (up to 0.3 mM |CITS:[WEINER87]|).  It has been proposed that the utilization of pyrophosphate rather than that of ATP in glycolysis is favored under nutritional <i>Pi</i> deprivation or oxygen deficiency |CITS:[DAVIES93],[15012287]|.  The latter reaction, EC 1.2.1.9, provides a bypass between |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:G3P|, which allows for their conversion without phosphorylation by a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase |CITS:[15012287],[16927206]|.  This reaction produces |FRAME:NADPH| but not |FRAME:ATP|.
/
/The overall process, which requires the initial investment of one molecule of ATP to produce |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|, yields four molecules of ATP and two molecules of |FRAME:NADH| for every molecule of hexose fed to the system.  The fate of the final product of glycolysis, |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, depends on the state of the oxygen supply and can be consumed, for example, by the |FRAME:TCA| via the formation |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| in aerobic conditions, or degraded to ethanol or lactate under anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME:PWY-3801|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In prokaryotes and eukaryotes the four-carbon amino acid aspartate is converted to the corresponding keto acid 
/oxaloacetate by transamination using &alpha;-ketoglutarate as acceptor of the amino group.  This reversible 
/reaction also biosynthesizes aspartate (see pathway |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  Oxaloacetate is a 
/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, as shown in the pathway link.  Oxaloacetate can also be 
/converted by phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxykinase to phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate for use in 
/gluconeogenesis (see pathway |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY|).  Aspartate is therefore a link between amino acid 
/and carbohydrate metabolism.  In addition, aspartate is a precursor for the biosynthesis of many other compounds 
/including lysine, threonine, methionine and NAD<sup>+</sup> 
/(see |FRAME: PWY0-781| and |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  
/
/There are also several other routes for aspartate degradation.  In mammals and most land vertebrates, aspartate 
/can be degraded by entering the urea cycle at the point of citrulline, and is ultimately converted to fumarate 
/(see pathway |FRAME: PWY-4984|).  In another eukaryotic route, aspartate is degraded to malate as part of the 
/reversible malate-aspartate shuttle found in liver, heart and kidney.  This is one of several shuttle mechanisms 
/used to transfer electrons from cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis into the mitochondrion, because NADH 
/itself cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane (see pathway 
/|FRAME: MALATE-ASPARTATE-SHUTTLE-PWY|).  In prokaryotes, aspartate can be degraded to 
/fumarate by |FRAME: ASPARTASE-CPLX| (see pathway |FRAME: GLUTDEG-PWY|).  |CITS: [VOET04]|

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Many organisms can synthesize guanosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: GMP| (GMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| (XMP) , which is converted to GMP by the action of |FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate (see |FRAME: PWY-6125|). Note that the free base |FRAME: GUANINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: GUANOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms also use salvage enzymes to obtain purine bases and nucleosides and convert them to the corresponding nucleotides. The pathway described here is used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms for this purpose.
/For example, all parasitic protozoa (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|, |FRAME: TAX-5810|, |FRAME: TAX-38568|, |FRAME: TAX-5690|) lack the ability to synthesize purine nucleotides <i>de novo</i>and use this salvage pathway to convert purine bases and nucleosides obtained from their hosts to the corresponding nucleotides |CITS: [3920982][6316234]|. After their uptake by specific transporters |CITS: [ 7443300][ 10743614]| the purine nucleosides are first hydrolyzed to ribose and a base by nucleoside hydrolases. The bases are then converted to the concomitant nucleotides by |FRAME: GPT-CPLX|, which utilizes |FRAME: PRPP| to convert the free base to the mononucleotide |FRAME: GMP|.
/Nucleoside hydrolases from parasites are attractive drug targets against parasitic protozoa since no such activity has been reported thus far in mammalian cells |CITS: [6396514]|.
/
/The pathway has also been described in green plants |CITS: [GURANOWSKI79]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals. The assembly of TAG occurs in 
/the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions are catalyzed by ER membrane bound 
/enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the 
/synthesis of membrane lipids glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the 
/pathway, catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol 
/synthesis.
/
/The traditional Kennedy pathway does not include the reaction (EC 2.3.1.158, phospholipid:diacylglycerol 
/acyltransferase, PDAT) where phospholipid is 
/utilized as the acyl donor in TAG formation. The role of the PDAT route in TAG 
/biosynthesis was clearly shown in yeast |CITS: [10829075]|. PDAT activity in plants was demonstrated 
/in a few oil seed plants including
/caster bean |CITS: [10829075]|. The caster bean seeds have a high content of
/ricinoleat in the seed oil. Ricinoleat and other unusual fatty acids are
/modified from acyl groups linked to phospholipids, and transferred to
/TAG afterwards. PDAT was proposed playing an important role in
/the last step. However, the contribution of PDAT to TAG biosynthesis in other
/plants is not clear. Overexpressing or knockout of the Arabidopsis PDAT had
/no effect on TAG biosynthesis |CITS: [15247387][15907694]|. 
/
/The well-coordinated regulation of lipid homeostasis in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is exemplified by the cooperation of two enzymes operating through catabolic and anabolic steps of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism. The formation of diacylglycerol, a precursor for TAG and phospholipid biosynthesis, is catalyzed both by the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4 |CITS:[16135509]| and phosphatidate phosphatase PAH1 |CITS:[2542283]|, the former catalyzing the degradation of TAG and the latter forming DAG by dephosphorylation of phosphatidate (PA). Both enzymes are controlled in their activity by Cdk1/Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation, with TGL4 being phosphorylated (activated) and PAH1 being phosphorylated (deactivated) at different times in the cell cycle |CITS:[19150427]|. The interaction of two enzymes involved in different metabolic events of TAG metabolism which are controlled by the same cyclin-dependent kinase ensures a steady and regulated flow of precursors for membrane phospholipid synthesis highlighting the importance of TAG homeostasis in the critical phase of cell growth in yeast |CITS:[22910056]|. 
/
/
/A third route forming TAG may also exist. Diacylglycerol transacylase activity was detected in plant |CITS: [Stobart97]| as well as in animal |CITS: [8473321]|. It catalyzes the formation of one molecule TAG and one molecule monoacylglycerol from two molecules of diacylglycerol. 
/
/The constitution of different species of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-1, sn-2, and 
/sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone varies among different plants, and is determined by substrate 
/specificities of the three acyltransferases involved in this pathway. The composition of distinct fatty acids 
/in TAG determines the quality and property of lipids of different plants, and also contributes to cold 
/temperature sensitivity of different plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|  (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent
/findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|. In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme |FRAME: GLUTDECARBOX-RXN "glutamate decarboxylase"|.
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|. Different variants of both enzymes are known. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862| |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|). Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirement, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.
/
/The action of glutamate decarboxylase, &gamma;-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and succinate semialdehyde
/dehydrogenase, combined, defines a short pathway known as the "GABA shunt", since it can channel glutamate into the |FRAME: TCA|, bypassing two steps of that cycle.  
/
/While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capability to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria can synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation "putrescine degradation"|). 
/The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|
/|CITS:[13654294][13654295]|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| is a neurotransmitter inhibitor and is known to lower the blood pressure in humans |CITS: [12627188]|. The foods containing |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| or GABA receives a lot of attention due to their known human health benefits. Wheat germ, wine and chocolate are some of the food products containing |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|. Several plants synthesize GABA under stress conditions such as anaerobic conditions, low pH, low or high temperatures, darkness, and mechanical manipulation.
/GABA in plants provides protection against oxidative stress, and is also involved in pollen growth and development. |FRAME: TAX-4081| plants have relatively higher levels of GABA |CITS: [17955994]|, the molecular mechanism underlying GABA accumulation and catabolism is only now being revealed with several enzymes in this pathways being cloned and characterized |CITS: [18713763]|.
/
/
/It is currently assumed that the main GABA transaminase in plants utilizes pyruvate rather than 2-ketoglutarate. In |FRAME: TAX-3702|, only the |FRAME: AT3G22200-LER| gene, which encodes a |FRAME: PYRUVATE|-dependent transminase (GABA-TP), have been isolated. In an <i>in vitro</i> study, recombinant Arabidopsis GABA-TP used pyruvate and glyoxylate but not 2;-ketoglutarate as an amine acceptor |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|. The GABA contents in flowers of an Arabidopsis GABA-TP-disrupted mutant were 100-fold higher than those measured in wild-type plants |CITS: [12859897]|.
/Transaminase activity has also been studied in soybean seeds, rice roots, tobacco leaves, radish mature leaves, tomato leaves and potato tubers, and in all of these cases, pyruvate-dependent activities were 1.2-19 times higher than 2-ketoglutarate-dependent activities |CITS: [16658005][Reggiani88][16663565][Shelp95]|.
/
/The dehydrogenases studied from plants so far appear to prefer NAD |CITS: [18713763]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments; light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy, keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly, developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.

/The epoxidation reaction of the xanthophyll cycle consists of the conversion of zeaxanthin to antheraxanthin and violaxanthin and is carried out by the zeaxanthin epoxidase. The isolated cDNA for this enzyme from tobacco was used to identify potential epoxidases of other plants. It has been demonstrated that in |FRAME:TAX-3701|  plants defective in osmotic stress-regulated gene induction the LOS6/ABA1 gene encodes a zeaxanthin epoxidase that functions in ABA

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/A significant amount of the fatty acids synthesized in animals by the cytosolic enzyme complex fatty acid synthase (FAS) or taken up by the diet are further elongated into |FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "very long chain fatty acids"| (VLCFAs), which are at least 22 carbons in length. VLCFAs are also important in plants, where they are the main constituents of hydrophobic polymers (such as cuticular waxes, seed oils and membrane sphingolipids) that prevent dessication at the leaf surface and provide stability to pollen grains |CITS: [15277688]|.
/
/VLCFAs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum by sequential addition of C2 moieties from |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to preformed C18 acyl groups derived from the <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Each elongation cycle is composed of 4 reactions, similar to <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis. The cycle includes the condensation of |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs| and |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to form |FRAME: 3-KETOACYL-COA|, reduction to
/|FRAME: 3-HYDROXYACYL-COA|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-COA|, and a final reduction to yield a chain-elongated fatty acyl-CoA |CITS:[16564093]|.
/
/Unlike in <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis, |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| rather than |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| is used in the condensing reaction. The elongation cycle is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, the elongase |CITS: [10907783]|, which is composed of four enzymes, |FRAME: AT4G34520-MONOMER| or condensing enzyme |CITS:  [11341960]|, 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, |FRAME: AT5G10480-MONOMER| and |FRAME: AT3G55360-MONOMER| |CITS: [15829606]|.
/
/Substrate and tissue specificity of VLCFAs elongation is determined by the condensing enzyme, which catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are elongated via this pathway. While both NADPH and NADH were shown to be an effective reducing power for the two reduction steps, in many cases NADPH is the 'preferred' reductant (reviewed in |CITS: [8190743]| and |CITS: [16564093]|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see for example |FRAME: PWY-6893|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin. Starting with |FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE|, an intermdiate in purine biosynthesis, two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by |FRAME: THIC-MONOMER "ThiC"| and |FRAME: HMP-P-KIN-CPLX "ThiD"|, produce |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|.
/The first reaction is one of the most complicated rearrangement reactions known. The ThiC enzyme belongs to the radical SAM family, all members of which utilize |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) to generate an 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical that in turn serves as an oxidant for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions |CITS: [18953358]|. The first stage of catalysis is the reduction of SAM to produce |FRAME: MET| and a 5-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated at the active site. The radical reacts directly with the substrate to catalyze a complex rearrangement reaction that includes two iterative hydrogen atom abstractions (which necessitates the regeneration of the radical following the first abstraction). C1' and C3' of the substrate, which are not inorporated into the product, are converted to formate and carbon monoxide, respectively |CITS: [20886485]|.
/
/The second enzyme, ThiD, is a simple kinase. It is a bifunctional enzyme, and can also phosphorylate |FRAME: HMP|, as a part of a thiamin salvage pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6897|) |CITS: [14973012]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: VAL| is one of the three main branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with |FRAME: LEU|
/and |FRAME: ILE|.
/The catabolic pathways of the BCAAs can be divided into two sequential series of reactions, referred to
/as the common pathway and the distal pathway.
/
/The common pathway includes the enzymes |FRAME: CPLX-6941|, |FRAME: CPLX-6940|, and
/|FRAME: CPLX-6942|. These three enzymes catalyze the conversion of all three BCAAs to their
/respective acyl-CoA derivatives
/(|FRAME:METHACRYLYL-COA|, |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, and |FRAME: CPD-1083|
/for |FRAME:VAL|, |FRAME:LEU|, and |FRAME:ILE|, respectively), though the intermediates formed
/by these enzymes are different for the different amino acids.
/The distal parts of the pathway are completely different for the three BCAAs, and comprise enzymes
/specific for each amino acid |CITS: [773366]|.
/
/
/The catabolism of |FRAME: VAL| involves its conversion via |FRAME:2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| to
/|FRAME:ISOBUTYRYL-COA|, which is desaturated to form the &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated
/thioester |FRAME:METHACRYLYL-COA|. Hydration to |FRAME:3-HYDROXY-ISOBUTYRYL-COA|
/and thioester hydrolysis forms the diffusible and transportable compound
/|FRAME:3-HYDROXY-ISOBUTYRATE|.
/Finally, this &beta;-hydroxy acid is oxidized to |FRAME:CH3-MALONATE-S-ALD|
/and thioesterified to form |FRAME:PROPIONYL-COA|.
/
/The pathway is widely distributed and has been demonstrated in bacteria |CITS: [4957438][5030618]|,
/fungi, cilliates |CITS: [13457352]|, higher plants |CITS: [Gerbling88][15280033]| and animals
/|CITS: [13233241][13398382][8824301]|. A few exceptions are |FRAME: TAX-83333|, which does not possess
/a |FRAME: CPLX-6940|, and |FRAME: TAX-4932|, which cannot use |FRAME: VAL| as a carbon source,
/and degrades it into |FRAME: ISOBUTANOL| (see |FRAME:PWY-5057|).
/
/In eukaryotic organisms the pathway spans both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
/compartments, as the first reaction takes place in the cytoplasm, while its product,
/|FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is transported into the mitochondria, where the rest of the pathway
/occurs.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CHORISMATE Chorismate| is an important intermediate that leads to the biosyntrhesis of several essential metabolites,
/including the aromatic amino acids |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|, vitamins E and K, ubiquinone and certain siderophores |CITS: [4200844][2279393]|.
/
/In this pathway, which is often referred to as <b>the shikimate pathway</b>, chorismate is synthesized from the central metabolite |FRAME:ERYTHROSE-4P|. 
/The pathway is found in prokaryotes (mostly bacteria) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. The presence of the pathway in many parasites and pathogens, but not in metazoa, makes it a prime drug target |CITS: [17348836]|. The broad-spectrum systemic herbicide |FRAME: CPD0-1308|, which is used to kill weeds (known best under the tradename Roundup) is an inhibitor of the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.19-RXN "5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase"| (EC 2.5.1.19), which catalyzes a reaction in the pathway (the condensation of |FRAME: SHIKIMATE-5P| and |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| to form |FRAME: 3-ENOLPYRUVYL-SHIKIMATE-5P|).
/
/The organization and structure of the shikimate pathway enzymes varies between taxonomic groups |CITS: [2824247]|, with a differential distribution of fused genes. In most prokaryotes the seven shikimate pathway enzymes are encoded as separate polypeptides. The plant enzymes (which are nucleus encoded, but assumed to function within the plastid) are also encoded as separate polypeptides, with the exception of AroD and AroE that have fused to a single bifunctional polypeptide.
/In contrast, all fungi, as well as the apicomplexan |FRAME: TAX-5811|, possess a pentafunctional supergene which includes conserved domains homologous to the genes (in fusion order) AroB, AroA, AroL/K, AroD, and AroE |CITS:[2825635][14711585]|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-562|, the first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by three separate enzymes, each of which is subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three amino acids that are synthesized from chorismate - |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|.
/The enzyme subject to regulation by tryptophan (encoded by |FRAME: EG10080|) cannot be inhibited more than 60 percent, ensuring that sufficient enzymatic activity is present to permit synthesis of the other four metabolites synthesized from chorismate even in the presence of all three amino acids |CITS: [Pittard04]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms is carried out in independent, dual cellular locations, the cytosol with fatty acid synthase (FAS) complexes (FAS I type) synthesizing fatty acids |CITS:[6137188] [16950653]| (for example |FRAME:PWY-5994|) and the mitochondria where monofunctional enzymes encoded in the yeast nucleus catalyze the various steps of fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II type) |CITS:[19028688] [9187370]|. The latter resembles the bacterial FAS II system (see |FRAME:PWY0-501|, |FRAME:PWY0-1275|) but except for |FRAME:CPD-195|, the precursor for |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| |CITS:[9218413]|, the functions of other final products made by the pathway remain unclear and require further research |CITS:[19028688]|.
/
/It has been speculated that the main purpose of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis lies in the maintenance of mitochondria |CITS:[11509667]| and respiration |CITS:[16246072]| which is closely connected to |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| biosynthesis and incorporation |CITS:[9037098] [9218413] [18779316]| but may also contribute fatty acids as constituent of mitochondrial phospholipid membranes |CITS:[Schneider95]|. In addition, novel links have been proposed to exist between mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and RNA processing where products from the mitochondrial FAS II pathway are required for RNase P activity in yeast which in turn is controlled by positive feedback mechanisms |CITS:[18779316] [19686777]|.
/
/The mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis type II is characterized by six enzymatic steps which produce an acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP). This acyl-ACP is condensed with |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| formed in the first two steps of the pathway which elongates the acyl chain by two carbons. The cycle is repeated until the final fatty acid has been produced |CITS:[18779316]|. The first and crucial enzymatic step in the pathway is the formation of mitochondrial |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| by the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase encoded by HFA1 |CITS:[14761959] [7906156] [Sickmann03]|. HFA1 is the mitochondrial counterpart of the cytoplasmatic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC1) also producing |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| which is however unable to permeate the membrane barrier of the mitochondria. The following conversion of |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| to  |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| is catalyzed by the malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCT1) |CITS:[9388293]|. In a condensation reaction with either |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| or |FRAME:ACETYL-ACP|, |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| is converted to |FRAME:Acetoacetyl-ACPs| carried out by the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase (CEM1) |CITS:[8412701] [7988550]| which is the initiating reaction into the cycle as well as the elongating reaction once the cycle has been run. 
/
/The subsequent reduction to |FRAME:Beta-3-hydroxybutyryl-ACPs| by the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (OAR1) |CITS:[9388293] [14562095]| is followed by the dehydration reaction that produces |FRAME:Crotonyl-ACPs| |CITS:[15387819]|. The catalyzing 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HTD2) differs from the prior enzymes in the pathway by a lack of homology to the corresponding prokaryotic enzyme. The final step in the pathway is also catalyzed by an enzyme which shows no obvious homology to its bacterial counterpart. The enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (ETR1) catalyzes the formation of the end product of the first fatty acid synthesis II cycle, i.e. |FRAME:Butanoyl-ACPs| |CITS:[11509667] [12614607]| which after condensation with |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| and required repetition of the cycle will produce |FRAME:OCTANOYL-ACP|, the precursor for |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| biosynthesis (see |FRAME:PWY-7382|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Backround</b>
/
/Polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| and
/|FRAME:SPERMINE|), a group of positively charged small molecules present in virtually in all living
/organisms, have been implicated in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids,
/stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.
/Although polyamines are clearly necessary for optimal cell growth, a surplus of polyamines can
/cause inhibition of growth and protein synthesis |CITS: [8223591]|, and thus a balance is desired
/between the production and breakdown of polyamines
/
/Several metabolic pathways for the degradation of |FRAME: PUTRESCINE| are known.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The unique feature of this variation is the enzyme catalyzing the first step, |FRAME: CPLX-26|.
/While similar pathways in other bacteria utilize an aminotransferase for the oxidation of
/|FRAME: PUTRESCINE| to |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRALDEHYDE|, |FRAME: TAX-1275| posseses
/a |FRAME: CPLX-26|, catalyzing a |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| generating reaction similar to other diamine oxidases.
/However, this enzyme differs strikingly from animal and plant diamine oxidases in both its substrates
/and inhibitor specificities |CITS: [Adachi66][4341347]|.
/
/The original literature focused on |FRAME: CPLX-26| rather than the putrescine degradation pathway of
/|FRAME: TAX-1275|, and as a result, the downstream steps are not known. The enzyme was shown
/to generate |FRAME: CPD-6124| in vitro. This compound is spontaneously formed from
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRALDEHYDE|, which is assumed to be the real product of this enzyme.
/The fate of |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRALDEHYDE|, though, is unclear. It is likely that |FRAME: TAX-1275|,
/like most other bacteria, posseses a 4-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase that can convert it to
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|, but there is no data to support it.

CITATIONS - PMNCVP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Jasmonic acid (JA), its cyclic precursors and derivatives are collectively referred to as jasmonates (JAs). Jasmonates are important intracellular regulators mediating diverse developmental processes, such as seed germination, flower and fruit development, leaf abscission, and senescence |CITS: [11607536]|. In addition, jasmonates induce plant defense responses against a group of pathogens |CITS: [10066616]| and mechanical or herbivorous insect-driven wounding |CITS: [1594598]|. 
/
/JA biosynthesis starts with the conversion of linolenate to 12-oxo-phytodienoate (OPDA) in the chloroplast, by sequential actions of lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC).  OPDA once formed in the chloroplast needs to be transported into the peroxisome where it is reduced by OPDA reductase to give rise to 3-oxo-2(cis-2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate (OPC8). OPC8, in its CoA form, is converted to JA by shortening six carbons from the octanoate side chain via three cycles of beta oxidation. The final steps of JA synthesis is catalyzed by three core enzymes of the beta-oxidation cycle, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX), multifunctional protein containing 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT).
/
/JA biosynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level. Strong correlation of gene expression of the Arabidopsis OPR3 (At2g06050) with 13-LOX (At1g72520, At1g17420), AOC (At3g25780), AOS (At5g42650) and OPCL1 (At1g20510) was reported in |CITS: [16963437]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In plants, |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| (GalA) is a major sugar residue of polysaccharides |CITS:[MOHNEN02]| and a minor component of some plant arabinogalactan proteins |CITS:[DARVILL80],[8727785]|. In bacteria, GalA is found in various cell-surface polysaccharides such as the O-antigens of the Gram-negative bacteria  |FRAME: TAX-1162729| and |FRAME: TAX-45888| |CITS:[14670712]|.
/
/The incorporation of GalA into those polysaccharides is performed by transfer of the GalA residue from its activated nucleotide-sugar form |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE| (UDP-GalA). This nucleotide sugar is formed through the conversion of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| (UDP-GlcA) to UDP-GalA by a nucleotide-sugar 4-epimerase |CITS: [15563616]|.  For some plants, the |FRAME:PWY-4841| pathway was shown to be a major source of UDP-GalA |CITS:[LOEWUS82]|.  However, <i>myo</i>-inositol is not always a quantitatively important source of carbon for cell wall uronide and pentose units |CITS:[LOEWUS82]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The glyoxylate cycle is a sequence of anaplerotic reactions (reactions that form metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis) that enables an organism to use substrates that enter central carbon metabolism at the level of |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| as the sole carbon source. Such substrates include fatty acids, alcohols, and esters (often the products of fermentation),
/as well as waxes, alkenes, and methylated compounds. The pathway does not occur in vertebrates, but it is found in plants and certain bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates.
/
/The pathway is essentially a modified version of the |FRAME:TCA| that bypasses those steps in the cycle that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|. Acetyl-CoA enters the cycle at two steps, but no carbon escapes it in the form of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/
/The glyoxylate cycle uses a two-step bypass. One key enzyme, |FRAME:CPLX-1402| (EC 4.1.3.1), converts |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to form |FRAME: SUC| and |FRAME: GLYOX|. A second key enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX-1403| (EC 2.3.3.9), condenses glyoxylate and a second molecule of |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to form |FRAME:MAL|. The subsequent oxidation of malate regenerates the initial acetyl-CoA acceptor molecule of the TCA cycle, |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|. Thus, the |FRAME: SUC| that was formed by |FRAME:CPLX-1402| (EC 4.1.3.1) can be withdrawn from the cycle and used for cell carbon biosynthesis.
/
/The pathway was originally discovered in bacteria |CITS: [13430766]|, but later was found to operate in some eukaryotic organisms as well. In plants the cycle is invovled in the metabolism of storage oils during germination of seeds |CITS:[Brownleade97]|. The cycle also operates in developing eggs of nematodes, where it converts triacylglycerols to carbohydrates |CITS: [627278]|.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| the pathway is active when growth on 2 carbon compounds requires conservation of 4 carbon TCA intermediates. Two acetyl-CoA are taken up per turn.  The glyoxylate cycle is repressed during growth on glucose and induced by growth on acetate |CITS: [2512996][6378912][6389540][6329757]|.
/
/It should be noted that some organisms possess alternative pathways that convert |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to 4 carbon biosynthetic intermediates, such as the |FRAME: PWY-5741| and the |FRAME: PWY-6728|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Photosynthetic membranes, such as plant chloroplast membranes, need a certain amount of anionic lipids for their proper function. These anionic lipids can be either phospholipids such as |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| or sulfolipids such as |FRAME: SULFOQUINOVOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol| (SQDG).
/
/SQDG is also classified as |FRAME: Glycolipids|. However the characteristic structure of SQDG is the unique head group constituent |FRAME: CPD-10247|, which is a derivative of glucose where 6-hydroxy is replaced by sulfonate |CITS: [15012227]|.
/
/SQDG  is synthesized from |FRAME: UDP-SULFOQUINOVOSE| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.M2|. The presence of a possible sulfoquinovose nucleotide in algal extracts was suggested already in 1963 |CITS: [Shibuya63]|, but its existence was confirmed only in 1995, by its accumulation in an |FRAME: G-44027| mutant |CITS: [7592762]|.
/
/Insight into this pathway was provided with the discovery of a four genes cluster (<i>sqdA</i>, <i>sqdB</i>, <i>sqdC</i>, and <i>sqdD</i>) encoding sulfolipid biosynthesis in |FRAME: TAX-1063| |CITS: [1400200][1551852]|. It has been shown that |FRAME: G-44027| encodes |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.M2| |CITS: [7592762]|. Out of these four genes, only |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0578| has homologues in cyanobacteria. However, a gene next to it in the genome of the cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1140|, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0579|, was shown to encode the cyanobacterial sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthase |CITS: [10629209]|.
/
/The cyanobacterial |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0578| gene was used to isolate a cDNA for the orthologous |FRAME: TAX-3702| |FRAME: G-741| gene |CITS: [9465123]|, which was subsequently shown to encode |FRAME: EC-3.13.1.1| |CITS: [11073956]|.
/
/The synthesis of SQDG is not crucial under normal growth condition. It only becomes important when phosphate is limited |CITS: [9465123]|. Under such conditions, the increase of SQDG levels compensates for the decrease in phospholipids and ensures a constant proportion of anionic lipids in chloroplast membranes |CITS:[14675442]|.
/
/While the general scheme of the pathway is understood, there are still some unanswered questions |CITS: [17334828]|. The mechanism of SQDG assembly in bacteria like |FRAME: TAX-1063| remains unclear, as the function of the essential genes <i>sqdA</i> and <i>sqdC</i> is still unknown. Disruption of <i>sqdC</i> led to the accumulation of |FRAME: CPD-17933|, suggesting it may be an intermediate in the pathway in that organism |CITS: [9143325]|. In addition, the SQD1 enzyme of |FRAME: TAX-3702| was found to form a complex with |FRAME: EC-1.4.7.1 "ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase"|, and the significance of this finding is also not understood |CITS: [15752726]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC - this pathway), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway illustrated here presents the reactions catalyzed by the |FRAME:2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX|, a key enzyme of the |FRAME: TCA|. These reactions can be summarized by the general reaction
/
/|FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN|
/
/which is the form commonly found in the TCA cycle.

CITATIONS - PMNIC2017:EV-IC
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Cytokinins play important physiological roles in plants, from promotion of cell division, to release of lateral buds from apical dominance or delay of senescence. Although their biological activity, signal transduction and metabolism have long been studied, much remains to be uncovered of their genetics and biosynthesis |CITS: [11337393]|.
/
/The natural cytokinins are adenine derivatives and can be classified by the configuration of their <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-side chain as either isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins by far are those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.
/
/In terms of biological activity, it would seem that, at least in the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702|, two cytokinin species: |FRAME: CPD-4210| (<i>t</i>Z) and |FRAME: CPD-4209| (iP), are considered to be active forms. By contrast, |FRAME: CPD-4441| (<i>c</i>Z) exhibits only low or no activity in this plant. It has been suggested that |FRAME: CPD-4441| might contribute to the synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4210| through interconversion by a zeatin <i>cis-trans</i>-isomerase |CITS:[12231873]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4441| is described in |FRAME: PWY-2781|.
/
/Multiple routes have been proposed for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4210|. One pathway is described here. A second, tRNA pathway has been proposed based on the discovery that some tRNA molecules contain an |FRAME: CPD-4207| (iPA) residue at the site adjacent to the anticodon |CITS:[402938]|. The modification is catalyzed by an enzyme that has been identified in various organisms including |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [4346747]|, |FRAME:TAX-4932| |CITS: [4311031]|, |FRAME:TAX-1579| |CITS: [809333]|, |FRAME:TAX-9606| |CITS: [11111046]| and |FRAME:TAX-4577| |CITS: [342386]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway thought to produce the majority of <i>de novo</i> cytokinins utilizes |FRAME: CPD-4211| and AMP, ADP or ATP as substrates, and proceeds via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-4205|.
/The isopentenyl group of |FRAME: CPD-4211| is transferred to the N<sup>6</sup> of AMP, ADP or ATP, resulting in the production of |FRAME: CPD-4205|, |FRAME: CPD-4203| and |FRAME: CPD-4201|, respectively. These reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme, |FRAME: AT1G68460-MONOMER|. In |FRAME: TAX-3702| seven IPT genes have been identified |CITS:[11313355][11479373][12734720]|.
/
/It has been shown that an enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-12015| gene removes the phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: CPD-4205|, producing |FRAME: CPD-4209|, which can be converted to the active |FRAME: CPD-4210| by a single hydroxylation reaction |CITS: [17287810]|.
/
/In addition, another hydroxylase in known to act on |FRAME: CPD-4205|, |FRAME: CPD-4203| and |FRAME: CPD-4201|, converting them to <i>trans</i>-zeatin ribosides |CITS:[15280363]|. Following the removal of the phosphate groups from the di- and tri-phosphate forms, the product, |FRAME: CPD-4206|, is converted to the active form by the |FRAME: G-12015|-encoded phosphoribohydrolase |CITS: [17287810]|.
/
/Two possible sources exist for the prenyl group: the |FRAME: PWY-922 "mevalonate pathway"| (MVA) and the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| (MEP). In |FRAME: TAX-3702|, the plastidic MEP pathway is at the origin of the |FRAME: CPD-4210| species, whereas the |FRAME: CPD-4441| derivatives use the cytosolic MVA pathway |CITS: [14726522]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The acid sugar |FRAME: KDO| (known as Kdo for ketodeoxyoctonate) is a component of bacterial |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) and of the |FRAME: CPD-14581 "rhamnogalacturonan II"| (RG-II) pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants, including dicots, monocots and gymnosperms |CITS:[York85][7958328][shin97][9779594]|.
/
/The number of Kdo units in bacterial polysaccharides vary, depending on the species, but the majority of Gram-negative bacteria contain at least one Kdo molecule in their LPS.
/To date, the specific contribution of Kdo to RG-II function in plants remains largely unknown. 
/
/Kdo needs to be activated prior to its incorporation into the polymers. This activation occurs through the unusual coupling of Kdo to the monophosphonucleotide CMP |CITS:[11050325]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Despite incorporating Kdo into very different macromolecules, the Kdo biosynthesis and activation pathway is almost completely conserved between plants and bacteria |CITS: [23974348]|. 
/
/The pathway starts with the isomerization of |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| to |FRAME: ARABINOSE-5P|, followed by its conversion to |FRAME: KDO-8P| (KDOP), which is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.55|| (KDOPS). The bacterial KDOPSs have been grouped in two classes, and plant KDOPSs belong to a third class |CITS:[15070398]|.
/
/In the next step the phosphate group is removed from |FRAME: KDO-8P|, generating Kdo. This is catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.45|. It should be noted that the plant enzyme responsible for this dephosphorylation has not been identified yet.
/
/The last step of the pathway is the activation of Kdo to |FRAME: CMP-KDO|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.38|.

/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Phospholipids are important membrane components. Most of the phospholipids belong to the category of phosphoglycerides. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as phosphatidates, are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on carbon-1 and carbon-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to carbon-3 by an ester link. Phosphatidates are precursors for many phosphoglycerides found in animals, plants and yeast, including |FRAME: Phosphatidylinositols|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-SERINE|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN|.
/
/As part of the synthesis of phosphoglycerides, either the phosphatidate or the modifying compound need to be activated by |FRAME:CTP|. In some cases, the modifying compound is activated, as in the case of |FRAME: CHOLINE| and
/|FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|, which form |FRAME: CDP-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: CDP-ETHANOLAMINE|, respectively. However, in the case of other compounds, such as |FRAME: SER| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, the phosphatidate is activated first, forming |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|, which then reacts with the modifying compound to form the
/phosphoglyceride.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| in eukaryotes and some Gram-negative bacteria (primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|). In this pathway the production of the intermediate |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P| is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. The bacterial enzyme, encoded by |FRAME: EG10740|, can utilize either |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| or |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs| thioesters as the acyl donors, while the eukaryotic enzymes can only accept the acyl-CoA thiesters.
/
/The addition of the second acyl moiety is catalyzed by |FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. The bacterial enzyme, which is universally expressed in all bacteria, is encoded by |FRAME: EG11377|. As in the case of PlsB, the bacterial enzyme can utilize either a fatty acyl-[acp] or an acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor, while the eukaryotic enzyme can only accept acyl-CoA thioesters.
/
/A pathway that describes the usage of fatty acyl-[acp] donors can be found at |FRAME: PWY0-1319|. It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5981|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<B>General Background</B>
/
/Sphingolipids are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cells. They are composed of a long-chain base (amino alcohol), an amide linked fatty acyl chain, and a polar head. The predominant long-chain bases in plants are C18 amino alcohols, with sphinganine, 4-hydroxysphinganine, and 4-hydroxy-8-sphingenine being the prevalent long-chain bases. Whilst, the prevalent long-chain bases of many mammalian sphingolipids, sphingosine (4-sphingenine), is found only in trace amounts in plants. The predominant fatty acyl chains in plants are alpha-hydroxy fatty acids, with saturated C22 to C26 hydroxy fatty acyl chains, especially 2-hydroxylignoceric acid, are the most common ones.
/Ceramide (without a polar head group), glucosylceramide, and derivatives of inositolphosphorylceramide are the predominant plant sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin, which has phosphocholine as the polar head group and is the major phosphosphingolipid in animals, has not been detected in plants. On the other hand, yeast contains exclusively inositolphosphorylceramides.
/
/Species- and tissue-specific diversity of the long-chain base and fatty acyl chain exists in plant glucosylceramides. In general, seed glucosylceramides are enriched with dihydroxy long-chain bases and C16 to C20 saturated hydroxy fatty acids. In contrast, leaves are enriched with trihydroxy long-chain bases and very long-chain (C20 to C26) saturated and monoenoic hydroxy fatty acids. Monoenoic hydroxyl fatty acids are predominantly found in glucosylceramides from cold hardy crops and Arabidopsis.
/
/It is estimated that sphingolipids account for up to 10% of total lipids in plants. Glucosylceramide is the major sphingolipid. It is a significant lipid component of the plant cell plasma and tonoplast. While our knowledge of sphingolipid functions are mainly learned from studies in mammals and yeast, plant sphingolipids are thought to serve as membrane structural components and signal molecules.
/
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/Two mechanisms were shown for ceramide formation via condensation of a fatty acyl group with the amino group of a long chain base. One utilizes acyl-CoAs and is catalyzed by sphinganine N-acyltransferase, the other uses free fatty acids by ceramide synthase. The sphinganine N-acyltransferase route is most likely the major route in plants. The relative activity of sphinganine N-acyltransferase using acyl-CoA of varying chain length from 16 to 24 carbons parallel the distribution 
/of fatty acyl chains in glucosylceramides from different plant sources |CITS: [Lynch00]|. It suggests that sphinganine N-acyltransferase plays a key role in determining the respective acyl chain composition of naturally occurring plant glucosylceramides.
/
/Although hydroxylation of the long chain base can occur with free sphinganine, hydroxylation and desaturation of long chain bases, as well as alpha-hydroxylation of fatty acyl chains, occur primarily after the formation of ceramides.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants mainly occurs in plastids, although mitochondria are also capable to 
/synthesize fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|. The active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis are photosynthetic 
/leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. In plants, the initial condensation of an 
/acetyl group and a malonyl group to give rise to acetoacetyl-ACP is carried out by the condensing 
/enzyme isoform KAS III. The enzyme specifically uses the substrates acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP. 
/There is no evidence for the existence, or physiological significance if exists, of a bacterial version of 
/the initial condensation reaction, which utilizes acetyl-ACP and 
/malonyl-ACP |CITS:[plantbiochemistry97],[12624762]|. Acetoacetyl-ACP (a beta-ketoacyl-ACP) then 
/enters the elongation cycle, composed of four reactions. One cycle extends the chain length of an 
/acyl-ACP by two carbon units using malonyl-ACP as the carbon donor. The condensing enzyme 
/isoforms KASI and KASII are responsible for elongation steps from C4 to C16, and from C16 to C18, 
/respectively. Unlike their bacterial counterparts, plants KAS I and KAS II do not accept unsaturated 
/acyl-ACP substrates.  
/
/In most plants, the primary products of the fatty acid elongation cycle are 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP. The 
/first double bond is then introduced to 18:0-ACP by delta9 18:0-ACP desaturase, which is ubiquitous 
/to all plants. Additional double bonds are inserted to oleate and palmitate after they are incorporated 
/into lipids (|FRAME: PWY-782|, |FRAME: PWY-762|). Plants also contain very 
/long-chain fatty acids (chain length larger than 18). The additional chain elongation occurs via the 
/very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5080|) located in the ER. Free fatty acids are 
/released from acyl-ACPs and are exported out of plastids.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Six pathways are now recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of lysine. They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the |FRAME:CPD-468| pathways.
/
/In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine and isoleucine). All of the DAP group pathways share the upper segments, which include the four steps required for conversion of  L-aspartate to |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE|. They also share the last step, which is the conversion of the intermediate |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| (D,L-DAP, or <i>meso</i>-DAP) to lysine.
/However, these pathways differ in the routes leading from |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|. The four variations include:
/
/(I) the succinylase variant (see |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|), which involves succinylated intermediates. In this route |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is coverted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in four enzymatic steps.
/
/(II) the acetylase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2941|), which involves acetylated intermediates. This route also involves four enzymatic steps for the conversion of |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|.
/
/(III) the dehydrogenase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2942|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in a single enzymatic step. 
/
/(IV) the diaminopimelate-aminotransferase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-5097|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in two steps.
/
/In addition to lysine, all of the pathways in this group also produce |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is an important metabolite on its own (for example, as a constituent of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan).
/
/The two other pathways belong to the |FRAME: CPD-468| group. They are found in organisms that have no requirement for |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, as it is not a component of their cell walls. These pathways also share the first segments, leading to the synthesis of the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-468| (&alpha;-aminoadipate).
/However, in yeast and fungi, as well as  |FRAME: TAX-3038|, the pathway continues with the key enzyme |FRAME: YBR115C-MONOMER|, leading to the intermediate |FRAME: SACCHAROPINE| (see |FRAME: LYSINE-AMINOAD-PWY|), while in prokaryotes the pathway continues in a path similar to bacterial arginine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-3081|).
/
/Most of the bacteria that have been investigated in detail appear to utilize only one of these pathways |CITS: [1906065]|. A few exceptions include |FRAME: TAX-44252|, in which variants (II) and (III) seem to coexist |CITS: [BARTLETT85]|, and |FRAME: TAX-1718|, in which variant (I) and (III) coexist |CITS: [1906065]|.
/
/Lysine is one of the 10 essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize, and must therefore acquire in their diets.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Lysine biosynthesis in plants was thought to be identical to the prokaryotic DAP (diaminopimelate)
/pathway that uses N-succinylated intermediates (|FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|) |CITS: [15652176]|.
/However the Arabidopsis genome does not contain a tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase homolog
/catalyzing reaction EC 2.3.1.117. Further more, the Arabidopsis homologs of
/N-succinyldiaminopimelate-aminotransferase and N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelate desuccinylase,
/catalyzing the consequent steps 2.6.1.17 and 3.5.1.18, respectively, are not likely to function in lysine
/biosynthesis |CITS: [15652176]|. It was thus suggested that plants may synthesize lysine via an enzyme that
/bypasses the three reactions by directly converting tetrahydrodipicolinate to L,L-diaminopimelate.
/
/A recent article by Hudson and colleagues |CITS: [16361515]| indeed demonstrated that Arabidopsis
/has an functional |FRAME: AT4G33680-MONOMER| that fulfills this catalytic activity. The enzyme
/catalyzes a reversible reaction. Despite the fact that the forward reaction (towards lysine biosynthesis) seems
/to be unfavorable, the enzyme was shown to be involved in lysine biosynthesis under physiological conditions
/by functional complementation of an E.coli lysine biosynthesis double mutant of dapD and dapE.
/
/This pathway is found not only in green plants, but also in bacteria belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-1117| and |FRAME: TAX-1783257| |CITS: [17093042]|, and in archeaebacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-183925| and the |FRAME: TAX-183939| classes |CITS: [18371309][20418392]|.
/
/The first committed enzyme of lysine biosynthesis, |FRAME: MONOMER-11881|, is feedback regulated by 
/lysine |CITS: [8000011]|. Its catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step for lysine biosynthesis.
/|FRAME: AT4G33680-MONOMER| may impose another regulation point of lysine biosynthesis -
/using maize cultured embryo cells, it was shown that the overall rate of lysine synthesis is in the same range
/of the forward reaction catalyzed by L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase |CITS: [16361515]|.
/
/Lysine biosynthesis in plants occurs within chloroplasts. No evidence exists for extra plastidic location of the pathway |CITS: [15652176]|.

/The first 3 steps of this pathway are catalyzed in the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| by individual enzymes, while the last two steps are catalyzed by a single multifunctional enzyme|. |FRAME: TAX-4932| possesses two isozymes of the multifunctional enzyme, encoded by the |FRAME: YLR028C| and |FRAME: YMR120C| genes.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Purine nucleotides participate in many aspects of cellular metabolism including the structure of DNA and RNA, serving as enzyme cofactors, functioning in cellular signaling, acting as phosphate group donors, and generating cellular energy.  Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides is critical to normal function.  This occurs through a combination of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary. This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at |FRAME: IMP| to form |FRAME: AMP| and |FRAME: GMP|, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-1423|</i> and |FRAME:TAX-4932|, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa and plants |CITS: [8938402]|). The pathway appears to vary in archaea |CITS: [9150241]|. Some organisms, such as the mycoplasmas, do not biosynthesize purine and pyrimidine bases <i>de novo</i> and must rely on salvage pathways |CITS: [11737647]|.   
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4932| regulation of the pathway occurs at both the enzyme level as shown in this pathway, and at the genetic level. For example, at the genetic level positive-acting regulatory proteins Bas1 and Pho2 and biosynthetic intermediates |FRAME: P-RIBOSYL-4-SUCCCARB-AMINOIMIDAZOLE| and/or |FRAME: AICAR| are required to derepress <i>ADE</i> gene expression.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The inorganic sulfur compound |FRAME: S2O3| contains two sulfur atoms: a sulfone-sulfur (oxidation state +V), and a sulfane-sulfur (oxidation state -I). At low pH thiosulfate decomposes spontaneously to |FRAME: SO3| and elemental sulfur
/|CITS: [4552952]|. At neutral pH the compound is relatively stable, but several types of bacteria can catalyze its disproportionation in a process in which thiosulfate serves as both an electron donor and an electron acceptor. 
/
/Several types of enzymes have been described that are able to catalyze the disproportionation of thiosulfate. These enzymes have been differentiated based on the nature of the electron donor: some enzymes require thiols for this purpose, some utilize cytochrome c3, which receives the electrons from molecular hydrogen via a hydrogenase, some accept the electrons from the quinone pool, and some have only been active <i>in vitro</i> when coupled to cyanide. These four classes of enzymes are described in the pathways |FRAME:PWY-5277|, |FRAME:PWY-5352|, |FRAME: PWY-7813|, and |FRAME:PWY-5350|, respectively.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase is more often referred to by the name rhodanese, from the German word for thiocyanate, "rhodanid". The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors. The original description of rhodanese, purified from bovine mitochondria, used thiosulfate and cyanide for this purpose.
/Rhodanese is a widespread enzyme, and has been detected in many major phyla, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic |CITS: [6357923]|.
/Despite its ubiquity, the physiological role of rhodanese has not yet been established unambiguously. It has been suggested that rhodanese is involved in detoxification of cyanide in both mammals |CITS: [3073057][10762072]| and bacteria |CITS: [18685272]|. It has also been proposed that rhodanese, using the dithiol |FRAME:CPD-296| as the sulfur acceptor, may act as a sulfur insertase involved in the formation of prosthetic groups in iron-sulfur proteins, such as ferredoxin |CITS: [6430704][2983992]|.
/
/Rhodanese performs the reaction by a double displacement formal mechanism. The crystal structure of rhodanese from |FRAME: TAX-354| has been determined at 1.8 &Aring;, and the study revealed that the active form of the enzyme contains a persulfide, where a sulfur is attached to the active cysteine residue |CITS: [10788330]|.
/Unlike the enzyme |FRAME: G3O-33772-MONOMER|, which catalyzes a similar reaction in which thiosulfate is disproportionated into |FRAME: SO3| and |FRAME:HS|, monothiols such as glutathione are poor substrates for rhodanese |CITS: [14086740][5333153][10735872]|.
/
/The distinction between thiosulfate reductase and rhodanese is not always straight forward. For example, Aird et al purified an enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-471| that could catalyze either reaction under different conditions |CITS: [3480285]|.

COMMON-NAME - fatty acid biosynthesis initiation I
CITATIONS - PMNCVP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|, and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see |FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex
/(see |FRAME: CPLX-7627| from |FRAME: TAX-4932|).
/
/Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
/
/The best studied pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333|, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystalized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurrs in plastids, it has been shown that mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequnce, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-83333| has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, and this pathway describes the major route. In it, one |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| molecule is converted to |FRAME: MALONYL-COA|, which is then activated to |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| that is condensed with a second |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| molecule to form |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|.
/
/The first enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, is the controlling point for the flux of carbon into lipids. It is a biotin-containing multi-enzyme complex with two activities, |FRAME: BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, catalyzing two half reactions that combined condense |FRAME: HCO3| with |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to yield |FRAME: MALONYL-COA|. Further discussion of this enzyme is available in the pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1264|.
/In plants this reaction is catalyzed by the plastidic heteromeric |FRAME: CPLX-6282|. A second, homomeric form of the enzyme is cytosolic and is involved in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and synthesis of flavonoids.
/
/The |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| is next attached to |FRAME: ACP| by the enzyme |FRAME: MALONYL-COA-ACP-TRANSACYL-MONOMER|.
/
/The last step of the pathway, the condensation of a second |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP malonyl-[acp]|, is carried out by the condensing enzyme &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS).
/|FRAME: TAX-83333|, as well as most plants, has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases: |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively. |FRAME: CPLX0-252| is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA thioesters rather
/than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions. Unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/It should be noted that in some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-208964|, a different enzyme, encoded by the |FRAME: G-15300| gene, catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP malonyl-[acp]| |CITS: [22753059]|.
/
/KASIII is inhibited by long-chain acyl-ACPs, indicating a role in feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Since it catalyzes the first condensation step in fatty acid synthesis, it is able to control the rate of fatty acid initiation.
/
/The substrate specificity of |FRAME: CPLX0-252| is a major determining factor in membrane fatty acid composition of an organism. In |FRAME: TAX-562| the enzyme is highly selective for acetyl-CoA, and thus only straight-chain fatty acids are produced in this organism. In many gram-positive bacteria, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, the enzyme prefers branched-chain acyl-CoA substrates derived from amino acid metabolism, leading to the production of primarily iso- and anteisobranched fatty acids |CITS:[10629181]|.
/
/Other potential routes for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in |FRAME: TAX-83333| are described in |FRAME: PWY-5966| and |FRAME: PWY-5965|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Sulfur is an essential nutrient for all life forms. Plants, fungi, and many bacteria reduce inorganic |FRAME: SULFATE| to sulfide to cover their need for the element. Before the sulfur can be assimilated into biosynthetic pathways it needs to be reduced to |FRAME:HS|. Pathways catalyzing the reduction of sulfate to sulfide for the purpose of incorporation into newly synthesized molecules are called pathways of <b>assimilatory sulfate reduction</b>. In addition, certain organisms can use sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. Pathways of sulfate reduction for the purpose of energy production are called pathways of <b>dissimilatory sulfate reduction</b>.
/
/Sulfate can not be reduced to sulfide in a single step, and is first reduced to |FRAME: SO3|. However, two electrons required to reduce of sulfate to sulfite have a standard redox potential (<i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i>) of -516 mV, which is too high for physiological electron carriers |CITS: [860983]|. The problem is solved by the activation of the sulfate by phosphorylation, forming a mixed anhydride between phosphate and sulfate as in |FRAME:APS| (APS) or |FRAME:PAPS| (PAPS). This linkage lowers the potential of the electrons to <i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i> = -60 mV, which is easilly covered by thiols or pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [14627706]|.
/
/In plants, as well as in certain bacteria (such as |FRAME: TAX-1049| |CITS: [10939523]|), |FRAME:APS APS| is reduced directly to sulfite. In enteric bacteria, cyanobacteria, and yeast, on the other hand, |FRAME:APS APS| is further phophorylated to |FRAME:PAPS PAPS|, and only the latter is reduced to sulfite (see |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|) |CITS: [11940598]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Even though this pathway was intially described in plants, it has been shown to exist in some bacteria, such as |FRAME: TAX-1049| |CITS: [10939523]|.
/
/As described above, the initial step of sulfate reduction is its activation to |FRAME: APS| (APS). This phosphorylation is performed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.4| (often known as ATP sulfurylase). It should be noted that in some sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, such as |FRAME: TAX-1049|, there are two two such enzymes - an |FRAME: CPLX-8836| and a |FRAME: CPLX-8194|. Only the latter is relevant for this pathway.
/
/Two types of enzymes are known to catalyze the second step - the direct reduction of APS to sulfite - |FRAME:EC-1.8.4.9| and |FRAME: EC-1.8.4.10|. This pathway describes organisms that posses the former. The latter enzyme is described in |FRAME: PWY-6683|.
/
/Once formed, sulfite can reduced to sulfide by the action of multiple enzymes. While most bacteria utilze NADPH as an electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.8.7.2|), the plant sulfite reductases, as well as the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-1049|, use ferredoxin for this purpose (|FRAME: EC-1.8.7.1|).
/
/In bacteria and plants, sulfide is finally incorporated into |FRAME: ACETYLSERINE| by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.47| yielding |FRAME: CYS|, and later into |FRAME: MET|, which are the two major sulfur-containing precursor compounds (see |FRAME: CYSTSYN-PWY|).
/
/Earlier literature, describing work mostly performed with the alga |FRAME: ORG-6016|, describes a different sulfate reduction pathway in plants, involving thiol-bound sulfite intermediates |CITS: [16655178][16655893][16656806][4788946][398767]|. However, the purification and characterization of |FRAME:CPLX-7175| from |FRAME: TAX-4472| revealed that the only product of the enzyme is indeed free sulfite, and that the thiol-bound intermediates were most likely artefacts due to the presence of oxidized thiols in the reaction media |CITS: [10625629]|.
/
/
/<B>Regulation of the pathway in plants</B>  
/
/Sulfate assimilation in plants is regulated by several factors.
/
/(i) Developmental stage: the highest activities of sulfate assimilation enzymes are found in growing tissues including young leaves and root tips where there is a high demand for cysteine and metionine for protein biosynthesis.
/
/(ii) Availability of reductants: two of the enzymes in this pathway, APS reductase and sulfite reductase, require reductants (glutathione and ferredoxin, respectively) to remain active. In addition, the availability of reductants is related to the availability of light, the ultimate electron source in photosynthetic tissues. In leaves, the activity of sulfite reductase was shown to be directly linked to circadian phasing.
/
/(iii) Sulfur availability: gene expression of sulfate assimilation enzymes was induced by sulfur deficiency conditions |CITS: [9380766]|.
/
/(iv) Stress: gene expression was also found to be induced by exposing plants to heavy metals and oxidative stress |CITS: [9380766]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| (oleic acid) is the first unsaturated fatty acid that is generated from the saturated
/fatty acids produced by the fatty acid synthase. It makes up 55-80% of olive oil (although the free acid may consist only 0.5-2.5%) and 15-20% of grape seed oil and sea buckthorn oil.
/
/Oleate synthesis occurs with membrane-bound systems. The desaturase enzymes that produce oleate have been isolated from fungi, yeast, and mammalian liver and found to be specific for |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|. In plants, on the other hand, oleate is produced via |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs|, an acyl-carrier-protein bound intermediate |CITS: [4831331]|.
/
/In most plants, the primary products of fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME: PWY-5971|) are |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"| (16:0-ACP) and |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| (18:0-ACP). The enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7072|, which is ubiquitous in plants, introduces the first double bond in |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| while still bound to the ACP protein.
/The oleate product can either be utilized within the plastid for lipid assembly and further desaturation, or exported to allow further desaturation in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as incorporation into lipids.
/The fatty acids that are exported out of the chloroplast are first cleaved from ACP by thioesterases, followed by activation to fatty acyl-CoAs by an outer envelope |FRAME: AT1G77590| activity. Once activated to acyl-CoAs, they are exported to the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [14973169]|.
/
/The incorporation into lipids occurs via the |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY "Kennedy pathway"| or via alternative, acyl-CoA-independent enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.158| (PDAT) |CITS: [10829075]| or |FRAME: MONOMER-16590| (DGTA) activities |CITS: [Stobart97]| (see also |FRAME: PWY-782| and |FRAME: PWY-762|).
/
/Other desaturases that insert double bonds in positions other than the &delta;9 position of 18:0-ACP, have been reported. However, |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| is the only fatty acid that is desaturated in its ACP-bound form. All other desaturation reactions occur only after the fatty acid has been attached to a glycerolipid backbone. Unusual unsaturated fatty acids are mostly found in seed storage lipids.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12379 "Eumelanin"| is a common type of |FRAME: MELANIN| pigment, which is found in hair and skin. 
/There are two types of eumelanin, black and brown, which differ by their pattern of polymer bonds.
/A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair, while a small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow (blond) color hair.
/
/Spectroscopic studies of the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-12379| showed that it takes place in three chromophoric phases. The first phase corresponds to the formation of the red pigment |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| (&lambda;max 475 nm) (see |FRAME: PWY-6481|). The second phase corresponds to a purple intermediate, which was designated |FRAME: CPD-12378|, with a broad absorption maximum at 540 nm, and the third phase is characterized by a general absorption due to |FRAME: CPD-12379| |CITS: [Napolitano85]|.
/
/The oxidation of |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| to |FRAME: CPD-12378| occurs spontaneously <i>in vitro</i> but has been shown to be under enzymatic control <i>in vivo</i>. |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| is converted into two compounds - a spontaneous decarboxylation to |FRAME: DIHYDROXYINDOLE|, and an enzymatic tautomerization to |FRAME: 56-DIHYDROXYINDOLE-2-CARBOXYLATE| |CITS: [4031539]|. Both of these products are then oxidized to quinones, which are polymerized to form |FRAME: CPD-12378| and eventually |FRAME: CPD-12379|.
/
/In vertebrates, the pathway involves the activities of three related proteins, all members of the tyrosinase gene family: tyrosinase (|FRAME: HS01248|), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (|FRAME: G-11989|) and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (|FRAME: G-11991|).
/
/The enzymatic activities of |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER| and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (|FRAME: CPLX-8053|) are well established. |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER "Tyrosinase"| is the initial, rate-limiting enzyme of melanogenesis, catalyzing the first two steps from |FRAME: TYR| via |FRAME: L-DIHYDROXY-PHENYLALANINE| to |FRAME: DOPAQUINONE|, which goes through a series of spontaneous reactions yielding |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| (see |FRAME: PWY-6481|). Subsequently, the |FRAME: G-11991|-encoded |FRAME: CPLX-8053| converts |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| into |FRAME: 56-DIHYDROXYINDOLE-2-CARBOXYLATE| (DHICA).
/
/The role of the third family member, |FRAME: G-11989|, is less clear. Despite its structural similarity to Tyr and Dct, the enzymatic function of Tyrp1 is controversial and might be species-specific |CITS: [11775055]|. A |FRAME: MONOMER-15620| (DHICA oxidase) activity has been demonstrated for the murine |FRAME: G-11989| protein |CITS: [8027058][7813420][7855068]|, but in humans |FRAME: HS01248| and not TYRP1 performs this function |CITS: [9758418][11171088]|. As Tyr and Tyrp1 are part of the melanogenic complex and are known to form heterodimers, it is possible that the main function of human Tyrp1 is to stabilize tyrosinase |CITS: [7787879][9822646][18042623]|.
/
/The two products of |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| oxidation, |FRAME: CPD-12373| and |FRAME: CPD-12374|, polymerize to form a mixture of different dimers and trimers, known under the name |FRAME: CPD-12378|. The polymerization can be induced by the presence of certain metal ions such as |FRAME: NI+2| or |FRAME: ZN+2| |CITS: [Napolitano85]|, but could also be catalyzed enzymatically by |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER| or by peroxidases. Different routes were shown to result in the formation of different compounds.  For example, studies using |FRAME: DIHYDROXYINDOLE| as substrate found that the predominant product was the 2-2'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12408| when metal ions were added, but the 2-4'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12409| when tyrosinase was added |CITS: [Napolitano85]|. When peroxidase was added to the reaction, the 2-4'-linked dimer was still formed, but a third product, the 2-7'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12414| was also present |CITS: [Prota91]|. Similarly, when |FRAME: CPD-12374| was used as substrate, the predominant product was the 4-4'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12411| when metal ions were added, but the 4-7'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12412| when tyrosinase was added |CITS: [Prota91]|.
/
/Defects in TYR result in various forms of albinism. Mutations in TYRP1 in mice result in brown fur, but mutations in the human gene result in a form of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA3).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of AMP degradation is the conversion of AMP to IMP, which is converted to xanthine in two alternative routes, via |FRAME: XANTHOSINE| or |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|. The initial step of GMP degradation is the conversion of GMP to guanosine, which is also degraded to xanthine in two ways, via |FRAME: GUANINE| or |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|.
/
/Studies in tea leaves and cultured |FRAME: TAX-4058| cells showed that guanosine deaminase activity was much higher than that of guanine deaminase |CITS: [Ashihara97]|. It indicates the degradation pathway of GMP via xanthosine is likely to be the major route. Xanthine is then converted to urate by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|.  
/
/The product of this pathway, |FRAME: URATE|, is converted to to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. Plastoquinones also serve as a membrane-associated two-electron carriers in other respiratory electron transport chains. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K1), which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of |FRAME: CPD-12321| in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway for the biosynthesis of plastoquinone in plants starts with |FRAME: P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE|, which is converted to |FRAME: HOMOGENTISATE|. |FRAME: HOMOGENTISATE| is a branching point in the formation of plastoquinones and |FRAME: Vitamin-E tocopherols|. The committed step in plastoquinone biosynthesis is condensation of |FRAME: HOMOGENTISATE| and |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: MONOMER-3784|.
/A different enzyme (|FRAME: AT2G18950-MONOMER|) catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: HOMOGENTISATE| with |FRAME: PHYTYL-PYROPHOSPHATE|, the committed step for biosynthesis of tocopherols (see |FRAME: PWY-1422|).
/
/The plastoquinone biosynthesis in cyanobacteria is different than that of plants (see |FRAME: PWY-6978|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration that generates both energy and reducing power. In addition, it is also the first step in generating precursors for biosynthesis. The pathway is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|.
/
/The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, an activated form of |FRAME: ACET| that is generated by the degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A common source of acetyl-coA is |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is generated by |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| and converted to acetyl-CoA by the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"|.
/
/In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of acetyl-CoA into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP.
/
/The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that transport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes.
/
/The name of the TCA (short for tricarboxylic acid) cycle is derived from the fact that the first step in the pathway is attachment of acetyl-coA to |FRAME: CIT|, an acid with three carboxylate groups. The pathway is also known as the citric acid cycle, and as the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle (or just the Krebs cycle), named after the scientists who described it.
/
/Some organisms possess a truncated version of the TCA cycle, known as the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS "glyoxylate cycle"|, that converts |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to biosynthetic intermediates without the loss of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| |CITS:[6378912][3333001][3332993]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/One of the main differences between the eukaryotic TCA cycles (described in this pathway and in |FRAME: PWY66-398|) and the |FRAME: TCA "prokaryotic pathway"| is that the latter contains an alternative route between |FRAME: MAL| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.1.5.4|. That enzyme is found in some bacteria, but is absent from most eukaryotes, in which the reaction is catalyzed only by the |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.37 "NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.37"|.
/
/Another difference concerns the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Most prokaryotes possess only an NADP+-dependent form (|FRAME: EC-1.1.1.42|), which supports both respiration via the TCA cycle and glutamate biosynthesis for anabolic reactions. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have two types of the enzyme - an NADP+-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.42) and NAD+-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.41). It has been shown that the NADP+-dependent enzymes are involved primarily in glutamate biosynthesis, while the NAD+-dependent enzymes are those involved in the TCA cycle |CITS: [2198251]|.
/It should be noted that while rare, NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases are also found in bacteria that lack the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS "glyoxylate bypass"|, and thus are missing the enzyme |FRAME: ISOCIT-CLEAV-RXN "isocitrate lyase"| |CITS: [15653464]|. Examples for prokaryotes that contain an NAD-dependent enzyme include |FRAME: TAX-930| |CITS: [12204383]| and |FRAME: TAX-542| |CITS: [22117777]|.
/
/The only difference between this pathway, found in plants and fungi, and |FRAME: PWY66-398|, which is found in animals,  is the step between |FRAME: SUC-COA| and |FRAME: SUC|. While plants and fungi only use |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.5|, animals also use |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.4|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/
/|FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| (phytate, phytic acid) is one of the most prevalent forms of phosphorylated inositols in the eukaryotic cell, with a total concentration of 15-100 &mu;M |CITS:[3426614][1684044][8435066]|. It's cellular distribution is not completely known - some of it is soluble, some is "wall-papered" around membranes, while some is bound to proteins |CITS: [9838040]|. In plant seeds, large amount of phytate are complexed with cations and deposited as globular inclusions in membrane-bound storage bodies |CITS: [15700415]|.
/
/The compound has been proposed to have a number of signaling roles, including regulation of insulin exocytosis |CITS: [9114007]|, regulation of nuclear mRNA export |CITS:[10390371][10683435]|, binding of the clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3 |CITS: [1849645][1371119]|, inhibition of clathrin cage assembly |CITS: [7814377][7829485]|, and inhibition of serine and threonine protein phosphatases that are thought to regulate L-type Ca2+ channels |CITS: [9334307]|.
/
/<b>Phytate in Plants</b>
/
/In plant cells phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth. It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with different cations, including |FRAME: K+|, |FRAME: MG+2|, |FRAME: CA+2|, |FRAME: FE+2|, and |FRAME: ZN+2|, known as phytin |CITS:[11590064][8744268]|.
/Although phytin only makes up about 1% of the seed weight, it may contain up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus |CITS:[15700415]|. Phytate is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions in smaller quantities |CITS:[14568069]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most of our knowledge about |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| biosynthesis concerns lipid-dependent pathways, where the inositol phosphate precursor originates from a phospholipid, as described in pathways |FRAME: PWY-6361| and |FRAME: PWY-6362|. However, information exists that suggests that certain organisms synthesize this compound from |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| or |FRAME: 1-L-MYO-INOSITOL-1-P| that do not originate from phospholipids.
/
/To date such pathways have only been reported in two organisms - the aquatic monocotyledonous plant |FRAME: TAX-29656| |CITS:[8660287]| (described here), and the slime mold |FRAME:TAX-44689|, which utilizes different intermediates |CITS: [2198472]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6372|).
/The sequence of conversions from |FRAME: 1-L-MYO-INOSITOL-1-P| to |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| in |FRAME: TAX-29656| has been illucidated only by the use of radiolabeled compounds and no enzymes have been characterized from this organism. However, the pathway is also believed to exist in maize, and several maize enzymes have been characterized |CITS:[15237968][12586875][15918884]|.
/
/These include |FRAME: MONOMER-10801| (MIPS) |CITS:[15237968]|, which produces |FRAME: 1-L-MYO-INOSITOL-1-P| from |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate|, and |FRAME: MONOMER-10821| |CITS:[15918884]|, which which produces |FRAME: 1-L-MYO-INOSITOL-1-P| from |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|.
/
/The rest of the enzymes of this pathway have not been characterized in great detail as yet. While a  |FRAME:MONOMER-10868| that phosphorylates |FRAME: CPD-178| has been detected in maize, the exact nature of the kinase activity of this enzyme is not yet known as the reaction product have not been characterized |CITS:[12586875]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols are  compounds that play a major role in the detoxification of stress-inducing factors. In mammals, the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH). Toxins are conjugated to GSH in the liver by a dedicated enzyme, resulting in a cysteine-toxin conjugate. The conjugate is acetylated in the kidney to form mercapturate, and is then excreted |CITS: [8145281]| (see |FRAME: PWY-4061|).
/In addition to oxidative stress management, low molecular weight thiols have been found to be involved in critical cellular processes including DNA synthesis and formaldehyde reduction |CITS: [Patel98]|.
/
/Pathogenic bacteria live in a particularly hostile environment, in which the host deliberately generates toxins, including reactive oxygen species, to destroy the invading organism. Thus thiols are particularly important for the survival of these organisms. While GSH is the major thiol in eukaryotic organisms, Gram negative bacteria and the majority of Gram positive bacteria, it is not universal. In some organisms other thiols have taken its role, including |FRAME: CoM|, |FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, ergothioneine, |FRAME: CPD1G-2| and the ovothiols.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The synthesis of GSH from its three amino acid precursors L-glutamate, L-cysteine and glycine takes place in the cytosol. GSH is synthesized in all mammalian cells, many plants, and most Gram negative bacteria. In mammals, the liver is a major site of biosynthesis.
/
/GSH is synthesized in a two-step reaction, catalyzed by |FRAME: GLUTCYSLIG-MONOMER| and by |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE-SYN-CPLX|, requiring a total of two moles of ATP per mole of GSH. This ATP-dependent coupling of amino acid monomers and elongating peptides by soluble enzymes is very unusual, as oligopeptides are usually formed either by ribosomes or by |FRAME: Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases "nonribosomal peptide synthases"|. A similar mechanism is also found in the |FRAME: Acetylmuramoyl-Pentapeptide-Biosynthesis "formation of the bacterial cell wall pentapeptide"|.
/
/The first step in glutathione biosynthesis is controlled by negative feedback from its end product, GSH. However, feedback inhibition can be partially prevented by an excess of glutamate that blocks the regulatory site on the enzyme
/|CITS: [6151157][6137189]|. When GSH is consumed and feedback inhibition is lost, the availability of cysteine as a
/precursor can become the limiting factor |CITS: [9755286]|.
/
/<b>In plants</b> 
/
/Glutathione is an antioxidant that counteracts reactive oxygen species thus reducing oxidative stress |CITS: [NOCTOR98]|. It is recognized as a major player in detoxifying xenobiotics |CITS: [16665956]| by forming less reactive or storage conjugates catalyzed by GHS S-transferases |CITS: [15012285]|. Glutathione has also been reported to detoxify air pollutants such as ozone and sulfur dioxide |CITS: [16668420]|.
/
/GHS is discussed as important storage form of reduced sulfur regulating inter-organ sulfur allocation and its biosynthesis seems to be coupled with the sulfate assimilation pathway (see |FRAME:SULFMETII-PWY|) |CITS: [12481075]|. As a precursor for phytochelatin, the principal metal-binding agent in plants, glutathione is considered a vital component for the detoxification of heavy metals |CITS: [GRILL85]| |CITS: [16594069][11402187]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of glutathione is universally catalyzed in all organisms by two enzymes, glutamate-cysteine ligase
/|CITS: [May94]| |CITS: [15180996]| regarded as the rate-limiting step of the pathway |CITS: [1112810]| and glutathione synthetase |CITS: [8612643]| |CITS: [8914526]| |CITS: [15302873]|.
/
/The regulation of the plant enzymes is unlike those reported from other eucaryotes. For the glutamate-cysteine ligase a conformational change has been observed as means to modify enzyme activities in response to redox conditions. That differs from mammalian enzymes that regulate activity through a regulatory subunit of the enzyme |CITS: [15180996]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In the early 1990s, two groups working independently discovered a novel subgroup of the inositol phosphate signaling family in which diphosphate groups are added to |FRAME: CPD-1107| and |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| |CITS: [8440693][8382679]|, forming compounds that are now known as inositol pyrophosphates or diphosphoinositol polyphosphates |CITS: [16429326]|. These molecules have been reported to be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking |CITS: [12391334]|, transcription |CITS: [12828642]|, chemotaxis |CITS: [13678580]|, telomere maintenance |CITS: [15561716][15665079]|, apoptosis |CITS: [15533939][11337497]|, and DNA repair |CITS: [11851397]|, and to mediate environmental stress responses |CITS:[11956213][15316027][15342793][15936174]|.
/
/The concentration of the molecules appear to be tightly regulated with an extremely rapid turnover |CITS: [19326391]|. By inhibiting the enzymes that remove the pyrophosphate groups (encoded by |FRAME: HS03602|, |FRAME: HS10696|, |FRAME: HS04604| and |FRAME: HS05381|) it was possible to calculate that their cellular pools were normally turning over at least 10 times every 40 min |CITS: [8343137]|.
/
/The pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates has been illucidated. Two main classes of enzymes are involved in yeast and mammals: 5-kinases (encoded in mammals by |FRAME: HS10997|, |FRAME: HS00942| and |FRAME: HS08619|, and in yeast by KcsI) |CITS: [10574768][11502751]| and 1/3 kinases (encoded in mammals by |FRAME: HS09822| and |FRAME: HS07278| and in yeast by Vip1) |CITS:[17412958][18981179]|.
/
/All of these enzymes can phosphorylate |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE|, generating either |FRAME: 5-DIPHOSPHO-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-12346P| (in the case of IP6K) or a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-11700| and |FRAME: CPD-11937| (in the case of PPIP5K). These compounds, which contain a single pyrophosphate, are also known simply as 
/InsP7.
/In addition, each enzyme class can continue to phosphorylate the product of the other enzyme class, resulting in a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-11938| and |FRAME: CPD-11939|, also known as InsP8 |CITS: [18981179]|.
/
/Another inositol pyrophosphate that is found in cells is |FRAME: DIPHOSPHO-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-TETRAKISPHOSPH|, whose exact stereomeric structure has not been defined yet. This compound is synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-1107| by the three IP6K |CITS: [10827188 ]|, as well as the |FRAME: HS07712-MONOMER| (|FRAME: HS07712|) |CITS: [11226235]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays important roles in many aspects of metabolism. In plant 
/cells, there are at least four distinct acetyl-CoA pools in different subcellular compartments, the cytosol, 
/the mitochondrion, the plastid, and the microbody. Each pool is used in the biosynthesis of distinct 
/metabolites in the corresponding subcellular location. The cytosolic acetyl-CoAs are substrates for the 
/synthesis of many secondary metabolites including flavonoids and terpenoids, and very long chain fatty 
/acids which are themselves substrates for storage lipids and cuticle waxes. The mitochondrial 
/acetyl-CoAs feed into the TCA cycle for the generation of energy and reducing power. The plastid 
/acetyl-CoAs serve as precursors of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In the glyoxysome, acetyl-CoAs 
/generated from the breakdown of storage lipids are converted to carbohydrates via the glyoxylate cycle 
/and gluconeogenesis. 
/
/Research advances in the recent years have addressed questions concerning where the individual 
/acetyl-CoA pools are made from, especially for the mitochondrial, plastid and cytosolic pools. In the 
/mitochondrion and plastid, acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 
/composed of three enzyme activities, pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase, and 
/dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. Pyruvate is generated from glycolysis in the cytosol which then enters 
/the mitochondrion. In the plastid, pyruvate is generated from the Calvin cycle. Plants have two forms 
/of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, one in the plastid and the other in the mitochondrion. The two 
/complexes differ in many aspects of enzyme characteristics and regulations. In the cytosol, acetyl-CoA 
/is generated from citrate, which itself is derived from the TCA cycle and exported out of the 
/mitochondrion. The conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by citrate-ATP lyase. This enzyme 
/activity has only been detected in plants and vertebrates.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. 
/The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|,
/|FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism
/|CITS: [8676868]|. 
/Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been
/shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase
/in |FRAME:TAX-3701| biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|. 
/
/Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria, and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. 
/The biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail in bacteria. Sequencing analysis and some experimental evidence suggests that the steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway are responsible for the synthesis of the precursor pimelate moiety, and are described in the pathways |FRAME: PWY-6519| and |FRAME: PWY-6578|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described here.
/
/The first step in this part of the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10117|-encoded |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: EG10120|-encoded |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not
/require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.
/
/The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10118|.
/This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the
/source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.
/
/Recently detailed analysis of biotin biosynthetic genes was done with several additional bacterial species. There is much variation in the organization of the genes involved: In some cases all of the <i>bio</i> genes are organized within a single transcription unit (such as |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [8763940]| and |FRAME: TAX-381| |CITS: [11320134]|), while in other cases the genes are organized in multiple operons, sometimes at different locations in the chromosome.
/Some organisms even lack some of the genes - for example, |FRAME: TAX-1718| seems to lack the <i>bioC, bioH</i>, and <i>bioF</i> genes |CITS: [8161820]|.
/
/The difference between the biosynthetic pathways of Gram-negative bacteria (|FRAME: BIOTIN-BIOSYNTHESIS-PWY|) and Gram-positive bacteria (|FRAME: PWY-5005|) is upstream of the precursor |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|. Gram-positive bacteria generate |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE| from |FRAME:CPD-205| as described in |FRAME: PWY-6578|, while in Gram-negative bacteria |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE| is synthesized from |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| in a pathway described in |FRAME: PWY-6519| |CITS: [20693992]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway in Plants</b>
/
/The biotin pathway has been investigated using biotin-auxotroph mutants of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. It could be shown that two enzymes correspond to certain mutations - |FRAME: G-12146|,  which has been shown to encode the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-8566| |CITS: [8676868]|, and |FRAME: AT2G43360|, which encodes the |FRAME: AT2G43360-CPLX| |CITS: [8680961][0009501126]|.  
/
/Biotin synthase is the only enzyme of the pathway which has been investigated in plants on the molecular level |CITS: [8680961][9428635][11706201][12714594]|.
/Biotin synthase activity could be clearly demonstrated in Arabidopsis utilizing the synthase and accessory proteins from |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [11706201]|. It has been shown that mitochondrial components are necessary for the function of the enzyme, acting similar to the flavodoxin reduction system found in |FRAME:TAX-562|. The mitochondrial components identified were adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase and cystein desulfurase (Nfs1) which proved to be essential for the plant biotin synthase reaction and accommodates the cellular location of the enzyme |CITS: [12714594]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-P "Thiamin phosphate"| is formed by the coupling of two moieties, the pyrimidine |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| and the thiazole |FRAME: THZ-P|, which are produced by two different pathways. This pathway describes the formation of the thiazole moiety in eukaryotes.
/
/Genetic studies in |FRAME: TAX-4932| have demonstrated that THI4 is the only gene required for thiamin thiazole formation |CITS: [7941734]|. The donor of the sulfur incorporated in |FRAME: CPDQT-400 "adenylated thiazole"| was elusive for a long time. It has been shown that THI4 promotes a very unusual chemical reaction in which it acts as a co-substrate and supplies the sulfur through an iron-dependent transfer from an internal cysteine amino acid residue (Cys-205) to the reaction product. The reaction converts Cys-205 to |FRAME:2-AMINOACRYLATE| and renders THI4 inactive. Hence, THI4 represents a single-turnover (suicide) enzyme |CITS:[22031445]|. Insofar THI4 resembles another single-turnover enzyme, i.e. |FRAME:CPLX-8694| (THI5) which is involved in the pyrimidine moiety formation in |FRAME:TAX-4932| (see |FRAME:PWY-7282|).
/
/The protein, overexpressed in |FRAME:TAX-562|, copurified with its product (|FRAME: CPDQT-400 "adenylated thiazole"|) and two additional adenylated intermediates that shed light on its complex mechanism |CITS: [18652458]|. Similarly, in the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| the multifunctional protein |FRAME: AT5G54770| is sufficient for thiazole production. While it has been shown that NAD and |FRAME: GLY| are substrates for the enzyme, the exact source of sulfur for THI1 is still not known.
/
/The THI1 protein localizes to the chloroplasts, suggesting that this part of the pathway occurs in this organelle |CITS:[11575719][18048325][17174261][18332905]|. However, THI1 can also localize to the mitochondria |CITS:[11575719]|, and the downstream TPK1 and TPK2 enzymes are both cytosolic in Arabidopsis |CITS:[17611796]|, suggesting that intermediates in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway may need to be transported out of organelles for |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| synthesis to be completed.

/
/This universal pathway is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to |FRAME: TAX-9606|, although

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Gluconeogenesis is the generation of glucose from non-sugar carbon substrates such as |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, |FRAME: GLYCEROL|, and glucogenic amino acids (primarily |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: GLN|). The process is essentially the reversal of the |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| pathway. However, two glycolytic enzymes catalyze irreversible reactions. In order to enable the pathway to flow in the direction of glucose production, these reactions are catalyzed by other enzymes (|FRAME:EC-3.1.3.11| and |FRAME:EC-2.7.9.2|) in the opposite direction.
/
/Enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway are widely distributed in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and are often considered to be central to the origins of metabolism |CITS: [15803666]|. Note that this pathway describes gluconeogenesis in plants and microorganisms, the mammalian pathway is described at |FRAME: PWY66-399|.
/
/Bacteria use gluconeogenesis to synthesize glucose from non-sugar C2 or C3 compounds or the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle when there sufficient amounts of hexose are not available to them |CITS: [9168612][11815613][16109965][20439709]|.
/
/In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to hexose phosphate via gluconeogenesis. In plants, these hexose phosphates are used to synthesize sucrose, as documented in |FRAME: PWY-7347| |CITS: [Sung88]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Inositol is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"| is the  physiologically most common tereoisomer and is abundantly (but not universally) distributed throughout much of the biological system.
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"| is an essential polyol in eukaryotes, where its phospholipid derivative |FRAME: L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols phosphatidylinositol| (PI) is an important constituent of phospholipid membranes. PI is also cleaved by phospholipase C to generate inositol phosphate (IP) and diacyglycerol, both of which are central cell signalling molecules.
/
/In prokaryotes inositol is not as widely spread as in eukaryotes. While it is commonly found in archaebacteria, where its derivatives serve an important role in osmotic protection at high temperatures |CITS: [12220406]|, it is absent (or present in very low amounts) from most eubacteria, with the exception of the Actinomycetales group, which includes the streptomycetes, corynebacteria and mycobacteria. In these organisms a phosphorylated inositol is an intermediate in the synthesis of a major thiol called |FRAME: CPD1G-2| |CITS: [11544359]|. Mycothiol is important in maintaining the redox balance in the cell, in protection from oxidative stress, and in cysteine storage.
/In addition, the corynebacteria and mycobacteria produce several cell wall lipoglycans from PI. In these compounds the lipid moieties which are attached to the PI act as anchors in the cell envelope.
/
/PI-containing molecules have been shown to be essential for growth of the fast-growing species |FRAME: TAX-1772|, as mutants lacking PI synthase are not viable |CITS: [10889206]|.
/In most other eubacteria inositol compounds (small soluble molecules or lipids) are undetected or represent very minor components. Earlier work found that various strains of |FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-90371| and |FRAME:TAX-286| sp. did not contain any PI |CITS: [4552305][844323]|. Later work discovered readily measurable amounts of PI and PI synthase in |FRAME:TAX-317|, |FRAME:TAX-549|, and Ice<sup>+</sup> strains of |FRAME:TAX-562| (these are
/strains that promote ice-nucleation) |CITS: [1848220]|.
/However, phosphatidylinositol in these |FRAME:TAX-562| strains represents less than 0.01% of total phospholipid in the cells |CITS: [1848220]|.
/
/In all <i>myo</i>-inositol-producing organisms studied to date <i>myo</i>-inositol is produced via dephosphorylation of  L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate, which is generated from glucose 6-phosphate in a rate-limiting step by L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower oils. It is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals, that lack the &Delta;<sup>12</sup> desaturase that produces it. A few animals are able to synthesize |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6001|.
/
/Linoleate is an &omega;-6 fatty acid, referring to the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid.
/
/In all plant tissues, the major glycerolipids are first synthesized using only palmitoyl (16:0) and oleoyl (18:1) acyl groups, the products of plastidic saturated fatty acid synthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5971|, |FRAME: PWY-5989| and |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Subsequent desaturation of the fatty acids to the highly unsaturated forms typical of the membranes of plant cells is carried while they are already attached to lipids.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most of the oleoyl-[acp] is released from the [acp]-moiety and exported from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is converted to |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| in the process by the plastidic |FRAME: AT1G77590-MONOMER|. The |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| is incorporated into lipids, forming |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE phosphatidylglycerols|, |FRAME: Diacylglycerides diglycerides|, and |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE phosphatidylcholines|.
/Further desaturation of the oleoyl groups to linoleoyl groups in the ER occurrs while incorporated into lipids, and is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.22||, encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G12120| gene.
/
/A smaller portion of the oleoyl-[acp] molecules can be incorporated into |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE phosphatidylglycerols| and |FRAME: Diacylglycerides diglycerides| within the chloroplast. In this case, the desaturation to |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups| occurs by a plastidic desaturase (|FRAME: EC-1.14.19.23|), which is encoded by the |FRAME: G-10795| gene.
/Envelope membranes isolated from chloroplasts of spinach (|FRAME: TAX-3562|) could desaturate oleoyl groups in monogalactosyl diacylglycerol to linoleoyl groups. The desaturation required NADPH in combination with ferredoxin, and was also observed with other biosynthetic intermediates such as phosphatidates |CITS: [11607123]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium| is an essential trace element for many (but not all) organisms from all domains of life.  For example among animals, mammals require selenium but some protists, such as |FRAME:TAX-5691|, do not |CITS: [19279205]|.  The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii contains selenoproteins, but land plants and yeast do not |CITS: [12110581]|.  The best studied biological form of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| is the amino acid |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| (sec).  The compound display pages for |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| and |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| show links to enzymes in MetaCyc for which |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| is functionally important.  In addition, see EC 1.12.98.1, EC 1.12.98.3, EC 1.12.2.1 and EC 1.8.4.12.  |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| is also present in selenonucleosides that have been identified in bacterial tRNAs.  Reviewed in |CITS: [19344749]|.
/
/In |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| the thiol group of |FRAME: CYS| is replaced by a selenol group.  |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| is considered to be the 21st genetically encoded amino acid because it is co-translationally inserted into nacent polypeptide chains at an in-frame UGA nonsnense codon in the mRNA.  This is done by a decoding mechanism that involves a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the mRNA and coordinated interactions between RNA-protein complexes.  A model for the role of these cytoplasmic and nuclear supramolecular complex interactions in |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| biosynthesis has been proposed |CITS: [16508009]|.  The function of |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| in proteins remains to be completely defined, although its occurrence in the active site of some redox-active enzymes suggests a role in their catalytic mechanism.  There are two known pathways for selenocysteine biosynthesis.  One is found in bacteria (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-901|) and the other is found in archaea and eukaryotes (this pathway), which has interesting phylogenetic implications.  Reviewed in |CITS: [19344749]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/
/The pathway shown here is found in some archaea and eukaryotes, the best studied organisms being certain methanogens, and mammals |CITS: [17194211]|.  It is an indirect, tRNA-dependent pathway for amino acid biosynthesis in which the amino acid is synthesized on its tRNA.  A non-cognate amino acid is first attached to the tRNA and is then converted to the cognate amino acid by tRNA-dependent modifying enzymes.  Other examples of an indirect, tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthetic pathway are |FRAME: PWY490-4| and |FRAME: PWY-5921| (as compared with |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|).
/
/The difference between this pathway and the bacterial |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| biosynthetic pathway (|FRAME: PWY0-901|) is that in bacteria |FRAME: L-seryl-SEC-tRNAs| is directly converted to |FRAME: Charged-SEC-tRNAs|, whereas in archaea and eukaryotes |FRAME: L-seryl-SEC-tRNAs| is first converted to |FRAME: O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNASecs| by a kinase and the <i>O</i>-phosphoserine-containing product is transformed to |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| by SepSecS.  In both pathways, |FRAME: SEPO3| is the |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| donor, synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-678| and |FRAME: ATP| by selenophosphate synthetase (in |CITS: [17346238]|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [19344749] [18252769] [17916946]|.
/
/In this pathway of |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| biosynthesis on |FRAME: tRNA-Sec|, |FRAME: tRNA-Sec| is charged with |FRAME: SER|.  The seryl moiety of the |FRAME: L-seryl-SEC-tRNAs| formed is phosphorylated by |FRAME: MONOMER-14956| to form an |FRAME: O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNASecs| intermediate which is then modified to |FRAME: Charged-SEC-tRNAs| by |FRAME: CPLX-7880|.  Thus, the backbone for |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| is |FRAME: SER|.  Although the pathway is identical in archaea and eukaryota, a difference between them in |FRAME: tRNA-Sec| identity elements for the phosphorylation reaction has been found.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18252769] [17916946]|. 
/
/The |FRAME: CPLX-7875| step in this pathway is shared among bacteria, archaea and eukaryota.  However, this pathway then diverges from the bacterial pathway.  In the bacterial |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| biosynthetic pathway selenocysteine synthase converts |FRAME: L-seryl-SEC-tRNAs| to |FRAME: Charged-SEC-tRNAs| and |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| is incorporated into proteins using an RNA element that facilitates UGA recognition and the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor SelB (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-901|).  In this archaeal and eukaryotic pathway |FRAME: L-seryl-SEC-tRNAs| is first converted to |FRAME: O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNASecs| by |FRAME: MONOMER-14956| and the bound |FRAME: 3-P-SERINE| is converted to |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| by |FRAME: CPLX-7880| using |FRAME: SEPO3|.

COMMON-NAME - allantoin degradation to glyoxylate II
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698179970:bxue
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME:ALLANTOIN "Allantoin"| is a common product of purine degradation. Allantoin is rich in nitrogen, and many organisms are able to degrade and recycle it.
/Some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1458|, |FRAME: TAX-80866| and |FRAME: TAX-264198|, do so under aerobic conditions, while others such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: ORG-5985| and |FRAME: TAX-587| do so only anaerobically.
/
/Allantoin degradation is not limited to bacteria. Ureide-transporting plants convert fixed nitrogen in their
/roots to |FRAME:ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, which are then transported to upper parts
/of the plant, where they are degraded to release the nitrogen. In addition, some fungi and animals also
/degrade allantoin.
/
/The first step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|, comprises the hydrolysis of the internal amide bond of |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN|, forming |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| |CITS: [786256]|. This enzyme turned out to be common to all organisms that can degrade allantoin, and is the first step in all allantoin degradation pathways.
/
/|FRAME: ALLANTOATE "Allantoate"| is converted to |FRAME: CPD-1091| via one of two routes. In the first route the nitrogen is liberated in a single step in the form of |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: ALLANTOICASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.4"|), while in the other route it is liberated in the form of |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two steps, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-598| (starting with |FRAME: ALLANTOATE-DEIMINASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.9"|).
/
/The next step in the pathway is the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX|. Similarly, this conversion can proceed with the liberation of either |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-LYASE-RXN "EC 4.3.2.3"|) or |FRAME: AMMONIA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-HYDROLASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.19"|).
/
/Several combinations of these routes have been documented. Some organisms possess pathways that produce solely |FRAME: UREA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5694|), some produce only |FRAME: AMMONIA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5692|), and some produce both (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|). In addition, some anaerobic organisms can degrade allantoin to |FRAME: CPD-389| instead of |FRAME: GLYOX| (see |FRAME: PWY0-41|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Complete degradation of |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| to |FRAME: GLYOX| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|, without the production of |FRAME: UREA|, has been demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> with purified proteins from |FRAME: ORG-5993| |CITS: [19935661]|. The reactions occur in the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [16661891][20038185]|.

/There has been an ongoing debate which route is used by the soy bean plant |FRAME: TAX-3847|. Early reports found that different cultivars were utilizing different routes |CITS:[16664492][16664133][16665292][16666035][10944160]|. 
/Specifically, |CITS: [16666035]| found that the pathway in this organism proceeds without production of |FRAME: UREA|. It should be noted that a later study questioned this statement, suggesting that the previous investigations may have been misled by side effects of the enzyme inhibitor used. That study proposed that both cultivars are utilizing the same degradation pathway, in which the route from |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| to |FRAME: CPD-1091| involves the production of |FRAME: AMMONIA|, while the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX| was carried out by EC 4.3.2.3,

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate |CITS: [12633501]|. A variation of the pathway found in some archaebacteria and hyperthermophilic bacteria utilizes a dedicated carrier protein to protect the intermediates instead of acetylation.
/
/Several alternative arginine biosynthetic pathways have evolved in bacteria:
/
/In |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY|, which is not very common, the key intermediate |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.1|. A second key intermediate downstream, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|, is hydrolyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.16|, releasing acetate, and forming the arginine precursor |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|.
/
/In |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions mentioned above are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto glutamate, regenerating  |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).
/This recycling is performed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.35|. This pathway is considered more evolved, since the overall reaction is energetically more favorable |CITS: [3534538]|.
/
/The variant |FRAME: PWY-5154| is found in several eubacteria. While in the two pathways mentioned above |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is deacetylate to |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, which is subsequntly transcarbamoylated to form |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE|, in this variant |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is not deacetylated. Instead, it is
/transcarbamoylated directly by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.1.3.9|, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7224|. The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX| can accept |FRAME: CPD-7224| as a substrate, and deacetylates it into |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| |CITS: [16585758]|.
/
/The variant |FRAME: PWY-7400|, which has been described in the archaebacterium |FRAME: TAX-2285|, involves early intermediates that are protected not by acetylation but by a carrier protein (the LysW |FRAME: LysW|), which participates in the biosynthesis of both |FRAME: ARG| and |FRAME: LEU| in these organsims |CITS: [23434852]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This linear variant of the arginine biosynthesis pathway has been reported from the <i>Enterobacteriaceae |CITS: [3534538]|</i>, the |FRAME:TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, and the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME:TAX-34| |CITS: [ 9829957]|. The pathway was also described in the archaeon |FRAME:TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|, but in most likelihood that organism possesses a different variant of the pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7400|).
/
/In this pathway  glutamate is acetylated to <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG) by the enzyme NAG synthase, encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is  acetyl-CoA. NAG is then converted in several enzymatic steps to <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine. The acetyl group is removed in the form of acetate by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, encoded by the <i>argE</i> gene. Ornithine is then combined with carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, which is converted in two steps to L-arginine.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is able to utilize |FRAME: D-SERINE| as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen for growth |CITS: [1090588]|.  D-serine also has a bacteriostatic effect due to its effect on the biosynthesis of L-serine and pantothenate |CITS: [4574697]|.  Detoxification of D-serine and its utilization as a carbon and nitrogen source are accomplished by a single enzyme, |FRAME: DSERDEAM-MONOMER| |CITS: [14216615]|.  D-serine ammonia-lyase catalyzes the deamination of D-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia; expression of the enzyme is induced by D-serine |CITS: [13271312][14216615][14216616]|.  
/
/Recently, it has been shown that the ability to utilize and/or detoxify D-serine plays a role in pathogenesis |CITS: [12823810][17088369][17785472][19674114]|.
/
/The vertebrate brain contains significant amounts of |FRAME: D-SERINE| which has a role in <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function. In the mammalian brain |FRAME: D-SERINE| produced from |FRAME: SER| by the bifunctional serine racemase/D-serine dehydratase is mainly degraded by |FRAME:  EC-1.4.3.3|. However in the avian brain, D-amino acid oxidase is not expressed and |FRAME: D-SERINE| is degraded by |FRAME: EC-4.3.1.18| (D-serine dehydratase). In other avian tissues, both enzymes are present |CITS: [17254537][21676877]|. D-serine dehydratase has also been identified in yeast |CITS: [17937657]|. Like mammals, plants have a bifunctional serine racemase/D-serine dehydratase |CITS: [16483618]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6196|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).
/
/The pathway described here is found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In it the purine nucleoside is first hydrolyzed to ribose and an adenine base by nucleoside hydrolases. The bases are then converted to the mononucleotide form |FRAME: AMP| by |FRAME: MONOMER-11781|, which utilizes |FRAME: PRPP|.
/
/The pathway has been described in both prokaryotes |CITS:[4328693][11027694]| and green plants |CITS: [861230][GURANOWSKI79][12010467]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The purine degradation pathway plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in most organisms. The final product of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthesis, |FRAME:IMP|, is degraded through sequential enzymatic steps into |FRAME: URATE|, which contains a high level of nitrogen |CITS: [11891236]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5044|).
/In most organisms, including some bacteria, plants, and certain animals, |FRAME: URATE| is metabolized via a common pathway, producing the stereospecific form |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as the final product |CITS: [16317038]|. Some organisms that are not able to degrade urate include humans, apes, birds and reptiles |CITS: [16462750]|.
/
/It has previously been thought that |FRAME: ALLANTOIN| is formed from |FRAME: URATE| in a single step, catalyzed by |FRAME:ENZRXN-14266|. However, it is now established that the process involves three different enzymes |CITS: [16462750]|. In the first step of the pathway |FRAME: URATE| is oxidized to |FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE|. The oxidation can be carried out by two distinct enzymes: eukaryotes and some bacteria use |FRAME: EC-1.7.3.3|, as described in this pathway variant |CITS: [Modric92][Kahn97]|, while some prokaryotes possess |FRAME: EC-1.14.13.113|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7394| |CITS: [23760935]|.
/
/|FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE| is relatively unstable, and indeed decomposes <i>in vitro</i> to yield allantoin. However, this spontaneous reaction is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, because spontaneous decomposition yields racemic |FRAME: ALLANTOIN|, while organisms contain mostly the |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| enantiomer.
/
/An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N1-C6 bond of |FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE|, forming |FRAME: CPD-5821|, has been discovered and isolated from |FRAME: TAX-3847| |CITS: [10567345]|. An enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of |FRAME: CPD-5821| to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| was first discovered in mouse |CITS: [16462750]| and later purified from |FRAME: ORG-5993| |CITS: [20167108][20511299]|, |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [17567580]| and |FRAME: TAX-272620| |CITS: [20826786]|.
/
/This pathway is part of various metaboilc processes, including both degradative pathways, such as the degradation of purines to glyoxylate and urea or ammonia, and biosynthetic pathways, such as the plant biosynthesis of ureides, which is part of the mechanism used by tropical legumes to trasport the nitrogen fixed by their bacterial symbionts in the root nodules to the rest of the plant (see |FRAME: URSIN-PWY|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
/phosphate (NADP) are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell.
/Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.
/Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these
/compounds are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.
/
/Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. In reactions where NAD or
/NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate. During the reduction of 
/NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>)  the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while
/the second proton is released into the medium. Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:
/
/NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>
/
/Additional roles for NAD in the cell have been suggested, including involvement in transcriptional regulation,
/longevity, and age-associated diseases. In yeast, it has been shown that NAD affects longevity and
/transcriptional silencing through the regulation of the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases
/|CITS: [12648681][14724176]|.
/
/NAD is synthesized via two major pathway families in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the <i>de novo</i> 
/pathway, and the salvage pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate <i>de novo</i> pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety
/of NAD is synthesized from aspartate |CITS: [11153263]|, while in eukaryotes, the <i>de novo</i> pathway starts
/with  tryptophan |CITS: [12062417]| (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).
/
/The first attempt to elucidate a procaryotic pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960
/|CITS: [13731310]|. They implicated (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the synthesis
/of the pyridine ring of NAD in |FRAME:TAX-562|. Subsequent work by Chandler et al. |CITS: [4321550]| established that
/L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor. Suzuki et al., in 1973, established that the three carbon precursor
/is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and not glycerol |CITS: [4351074]|. 
/In addition, Andreoli et al demonstrated that quinolinate was a key intermediate in this pathway |CITS: [14013029]|.
/Eventually it became clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in this pathway, but in all known NAD
/biosynthetic pathways.
/
/<b>In plants</b>:
/
/In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate. However, the finding 
/of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (|FRAME:NADSYN-PWY| 
/in the genome sequence of rice (|FRAME:TAX-4530|) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and 
/remains to be further investigated |CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]|. 
/
/The genome of the dicotyledonous plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> contains homologs to all genes that 
/encode enzymatic steps in the corresponding bacterial pathway (this pathway). Many of those homologous 
/sequences are found in cDNA databases |CITS: [14593172]| which indicates their transcription and functional 
/role as protein encoding genes. 
/
/The first reaction is the conversion of L-aspartate to iminoaspartate catalyzed by the L-aspartate oxidase 
/(AO). This enzyme has been partially purified from cotton |CITS: [6338879]|. The cDNA has also been 
/isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and its molecular function confirmed through functional complementation 
/of L-aspartate oxidase deficient |FRAME:TAX-562| mutants (<i>nadB</i><sup>-</sup>) |CITS: [16698895]|. It 
/should be pointed out that the catalyzed reaction differs from the enzyme of the same name, assigned to 
/EC 1.4.3.16, which deaminates L-aspartate forming oxaloacetate and NH<sub>3</sub>.
/
/Comparable to the L-aspartate oxidase of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the quinolinate synthase (QS) of 
/this plant has been identified using a genomic approach. It could be demonstrated that the recombinant 
/protein complemented quinolinate synthase deficient |FRAME:TAX-562| mutants (<i>nadA</i><sup>-</sup>) 
/as well as the embryo-lethal phenotype of the homozygous allele in Arabidopsis |CITS: [16698895]|.
/
/The third reaction in the early steps of NAD biosynthesis from L-aspartate is catalyzed by 
/quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRtase) which has been isolated and characterized from different 
/plants |CITS: [4422841]| |CITS: [11198422]| |CITS: [16698895]|. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of 
/nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) the first intermediate that is also a component of the NAD recycling cycle 
/|CITS: [Zheng04]| |CITS: [16714307]|.
/
/The activity of the last two enzymes of the pathway, nicotinic-acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 
/(NaMN-AT) and NAD synthase (NAD-S) has been determined in tobacco |CITS: [WAGNER86]| |CITS: [WAGNER86A]|. 
/For <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> those enzymes have been shown to exist as homologs in the genome, each 
/of them encoded by a single gene |CITS: [HUNT04]| |CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]| but their biochemical 
/function remains to be confirmed.

/Glycine betaine can either be taken up directly from the environment, or synthesized. A common biosynthesis pathway for glycine betaine is from choline, utilizing a two-step pathway with betaine aldehyde as intermediate. This pathway is conserved in bacteria and plants, but shows divergence in the enzymes involved. Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and higher plants all use a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8) to catalyze the conversion of betaine aldehyde to glycine betaine. The choline-to-betaine aldehyde reaction, however, is divergent: Gram-negative bacteria such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-287|</i>, and |FRAME:TAX-382| utilize a choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1) (see |FRAME: BETSYN-PWY|), Gram-positive bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-1423|, use an alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (see |FRAME: PWY-3722|), while high plants use a choline monooxygenase (EC 1.14.15.7)
/(this pathway).
/
/Certain Gram-positive bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-1677| and |FRAME:TAX-1665|, as well as the fungus <i>Cylindrocarpon didymun</i>, use yet another enzyme to catalyze this conversion: they use a soluble choline oxidase that catalyzes both steps (see |FRAME: PWY-3721|).
/
/There exists at least one more variation for the synthesis of glycine betaine, which is found in several halotolerant bacteria. The pathway was found in |FRAME: TAX-1052 "<i>Halorhodospira halochloris</i> (previously known as <i>Ectothiorhodospira halochloris</I>)"| and several other organisms, which synthesize glycine betaine from glycine through a series of methylation reactions |CITS: [10896953]| (see |FRAME: P541-PWY|). However, since methylation reactions are among the most energy-consuming processes in nature  (the regeneration of one active methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine costs the cell 12 ATP equivalents), it is not surprising that this pathway is less common.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Glycine betain biosynthesis in plants differs from that in bacteria and animal. Plants convert choline to betaine aldehyde by the activity of choline monooxygenase, a Rieske type iron-sulfur-containing enzyme, whereas bacteria and animals catalyze this reaction utilizing either choline dehydrogenase or choline oxidase.
/
/The two enzymes of this pathway have been characterized in plants including spinach and sugar beet. |FRAME:TAX-3701| is generally considered a non-glycine betaine accumulating plant |CITS: [12192001]|, yet data suggests the endogenous glycine betaine level can be induced by cold acclimation and water stress |CITS: [11378169]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Triacylglycerol (TAG) degradation is critical to many plants for which lipids rather than carbohydrates are 
/the major seed storage reserves. The breakdown of the seed storage lipid provides carbon skeletons and 
/energy that can drive postgerminative plant growth before the plant root system and photosynthetic 
/capacity are fully established. 
/
/TAG degradation occurs in the seed oil body where TAG is deposited and stored. The liberated free 
/fatty acids are transported to glyoxysomes where they are converted to acetyl-CoAs via the beta 
/oxidation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5136|). The acetyl-CoAs are eventually converted to carbohydrates via glyoxylate 
/cycle (|FRAME: PWY-561|). It is generally thought that the hydrolytic attack of TAG primarily occurs at the sn-1 or 
/sn-3 positions but not the sn-2 position. Sn-2 monoacylglycerols are naturally racemized to sn-1 
/monoacylglycerols to be completely hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipases (pg255 
/in |CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]|).
/
/Despite the importance of the pathway for plants, there is still not much known about the plant enzymes 
/and genes of the pathway, especially di- and mono-acylglycerol lipases. To date, only an Arabidopsis 
/triacylglycerol lipase has been biochemically and genetically proven to play a role in the breakdown of 
/seed storage TAG during seed germination.
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the degradation of TAG and phospholipids is taking place in the lipid droplets |CITS:[16916618] [22345606]| where all the tri- to monoacylglycerol lipases of yeast have been shown to be located and enzymatically active |CITS:[10515935] [16135509]|. The major TAG lipase TGL3p also exhibited DAG lipase activity <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[16267052]|. The other TAG lipase of importance in yeast, i.e. TGL4 has even been demonstrated to represent a multi-functional enzyme which also acts as steryl ester hydrolase, sn-1 and sn-2 phospholipase A2 and acyl-CoA dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase |CITS:[20332534]|. In addition, the TAG lipase TGL5 has been found to be bifunctional and furthermore catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphilipids |CITS:[20016004]| indicating that TAG lipase enzymes of yeast are likewise involved in catabolic and anabolic pathways of fatty acid metabolism. The <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> activity of the only monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) in yeast encoded by YJU3 has been demonstrated in &Delta;yju3 mutants which showed no MGL activity but could be rescued by murine monoacylglycerol lipase (mMGL). Moreover, heterologous expressed and purified YJU3 enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed both |FRAME:CPD-11690| and |FRAME:CPD0-1812| to yield |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD| |CITS:[20554061]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| (often refferred to as simply linolenate) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) that is an important constituent of plant membranes. It is also known as an &omega;-3 fatty acid, referring to the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid. Seed oils are the richest sources of |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID|, especially those of rapeseed (canola), soybeans, walnuts, flaxseed (Linseed), perilla, chia and hemp. It is also common in the lipids that are found in thylakoid membranes in the green leaves of broadleaf plants, and in cyanobacteria and alga |CITS:[4621688][414660]|. |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| is an essential fatty acid for animals, and is considered an essential dietary requirement for all mammals.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In all plant tissues, the major glycerolipids are first synthesized using only palmityl (16:0) and oleoyl (18:1) acyl groups, the products of the plastidic saturated fatty acid synthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5971|, |FRAME: PWY-5989| and |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Subsequent desaturation of the fatty acids to the highly unsaturated forms typical of the membranes of plant cells is carried while they are already attached to lipids.
/
/Most of the oleoyl-[acp] is released from the [acp]-moiety and exported from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is converted to |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| in the process by the plastidic |FRAME: AT1G77590-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-5147|). The |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| is incorporated into lipids, forming |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE|, |FRAME: Diacylglycerides|, and |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5995|).
/Further desaturation of the oleoyl groups to linoleoyl groups in the ER occurrs while incorporated into lipids. The first step, which produces |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups|, is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-1903|, encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G12120| gene. The second step, which produces |FRAME: Alpha-linolenoyl-groups|, is catalyzed by the |FRAME: AT2G29980|-encoded |FRAME: CPLX-1903|.
/
/A smaller portion of the oleoyl-[acp] molecules can be incorporated into |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE diacylglycerol| and |FRAME: Diacylglycerides| within the chloroplast. In this case, the desaturation to |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups| occurs by a plastidic desaturase, which is encoded by the |FRAME: G-10795| gene, and further desaturation into |FRAME: Alpha-linolenoyl-groups| is catalyzed by two plastidic desaturases, encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G11170| and |FRAME: AT5G05580| genes |CITS:[12232435][11814526]|.

/
/|FRAME: CPD-7672 3-Methylthiopropanoate| is produced by several routes: (i)  catabolism of methionine |CITS:[479166]|, (ii) demethylation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in bacteria |CITS:[8899985]| or (iii) a shunt route of the |FRAME:PWY-5389|.
/
/In the latter route, represented here, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene is oxidized to formate and 3-methylthioproprionate.

/
/The enzyme responsible for the formation of |FRAME:CPD-7672| is acireductone dioxygenase.

/
/<b>Serine Biosynthesis in Plants</b>
/
/Serine biosynthesis in plants proceeds by two pathways, the so called
/phosphorylated pathway and the glycolate pathway. In the phosphorylated
/pathway (depicted here), serine is derived from 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of
/glycolysis. This pathway also operates in bacteria, yeast, and animals.
/In the glycolate pathway, which is part of photorespiration (|FRAME: PWY-181|),
/serine is derived from glycolate via glycine. The glycolate pathway
/dominates in the photosynthetic tissues. Most of the serine produced in this
/pathway continues with the photorespiration pathway and is returned to
/Calvin cycle via hydroxypyruvate and glycerate. The phosphorylated
/pathway is thought to contribute to serine biosynthesis in the dark and
/in non-photosynthetic tissues. Genes of the phosphorylated pathway are
/upregulated by high salinity, flood and cold. It indicates that the
/phosphorylated pathway is also important in supplying serine under
/environmental stresses.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Chlorophylls Chlorophyll| is a green photosynthetic pigment found in photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria. Its name is derived from ancient Greek: <i>chloros</i> = green and <i>phyllon</i> = leaf.
/Chlorophyll functions as the main light harvesting pigment in photosynthesis, capturing photons and transfering them to the reaction centers. Chlorophyll absorbs mostly in the blue and, to a lesser extent, red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence its intense green color. There are several variants of chlorophyll (|FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|, |FRAME: CPD-10334|, |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B|, |FRAME: CPD-18895|, |FRAME: CPD-10336|, |FRAME: CPD-10337|, |FRAME: CPD-10335|, |FRAME: CPD-18896|, |FRAME: CPD-18897| and |FRAME: CPD-18898|).
/
/|FRAME:CHLOROPHYLL-A "Chlorophyll <i>a</i>"| is found in all green plants, cyanobacteria, euglenozoa, and all photosynthetic algae. In these organisms, the pigment is found mostly in its monovinyl form (a vinyl group at C-3 and an ethyl group at C-8). However, its biosynthetic pathway involves largely divinyl intermediates (vinyl groups at both C-3 and C-8). Two different enzymes are known to catalyze the reduction of the C-8 vinyl group. This pathway describes |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.75|. The gene encoding this enzyme has been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-3702| and named |FRAME: G-9133| |CITS: [15632054]|. Homologues of the gene were initially found in the genomes of higher plants and green algae. A bacterial homolog was later found in phototrophic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1097| and named |FRAME:G-10101| |CITS: [17148453]|.
/
/The last step in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll is the esterification of a side chain. The enzyme responsible for the esterification reaction (|FRAME: EC-2.5.1.62|) prefers phytyl diphosphate, but can also use geranylgeranyl diphosphate, in which case the geranylgeranyl side-chain is subsequently reduced to a phytyl chain by |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.83|.

/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9)"| (UPRT), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step. The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants |CITS: [16660311][216696][2189783][8856065][11773618][14658380]|. This pathway was shown to be the major route for uracil salvage in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.
/
/Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).
/
/Some archaea, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7932| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 "EC 3.5.4.1"|) are also able to salvage exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by converting it to |FRAME: URACIL| (see |FRAME: PWY-7194|).
/
/Once the nucleobases are converted to |FRAME: UMP|, it can be phosphorylated to form the RNA building blocks |FRAME: UTP| and |FRAME: CTP| by the enzymes that participate in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway, as described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7176|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: LEU Leucine| biosynthesis involves a five-step conversion process starting with the valine precursor |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-562| both the first enzyme in the pathway (LeuA) and the terminal one (TyrB) are suppressed by leucine. TyrB is subject to inhibition by the pathway's starting compound, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, and by one of its off-pathway products, |FRAME: TYR|. One consequence of this inhibition by |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| is that in the absence of IlvE activity, mutations in earlier steps in the pathway cannot be compensated for by any alternate method of introducing |FRAME: 2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE| for conversion to |FRAME: LEU|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-562| almost all of the genes coding for enzymes in this pathway are controlled by attenuation. Attenuation in operon |FRAME: TU00179| is effected by a leader region containing four leucines and a transcriptional terminator |CITS: [6171647][6195343]|. <i>ilvE</i> is a component of operon |FRAME: TU524|, that has an attenuation region containing codons for isoleucine, leucine, and valine, as well as a termination site |CITS: [6154938][2007556]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The pyridine nucleotides coenzymes NAD and NADP are omnipresent in all living organisms and are involved in a vast amount of reactions with an enormous variety of corresponding enzymes (>17% of all classified enzymes).
/The majority of these enzymes exhibit absolute stereospecificity, and use the coenzymes as acceptors for a hydride ion (H-) or an equivalent thereof originating from the reaction substrate. In most cases there is a specific interaction between the enzyme and the coenzyme, causing a change in the coenzyme stereochemistry. Based on this fact the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes are sometimes referred to as "cosubstrates" |CITS: [3157549]|.
/
/The dynamics and regulative aspects of both phosphorylation and desphosphorylation of NAD and NADH are not well understood. Whereas the importance of e.g. NAD(H) and NADP(H) is obvious through their close involvement in energy metabolism and reductive biosynthesis, their interconversion and the role of some of the participating enzymes requires further research.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/NAD kinases are found in all organisms indicating a crucial role for this enzyme. The enzymes have been discussed in the context of maintaining a physiological balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria |CITS: [15247403]|, where significant changes in the NADP+/NAD+ ratio are observed upon oxidative stress |CITS: [11337409]|.
/On the other side a novel NADH kinase has been identified in |FRAME:TAX-3701| which is not associated with mitochondria and related metabolic processes. This NADH kinase has been discussed in connection with an increased metabolic flexibility of nicotinamide metabolism by uncoupling NADP+ synthesis from the redox status of the corresponding pool. However, further research is required to precisely describe its physiological role in the cell |CITS: [15347288]|.
/
/The interconversion of NAD+ to NAD(H) can be performed by two enzymes that are included in this pathway, the |FRAME: MONOMER-11877| (E.C. 1.6.1.1) where another pyridine nucleotide redox carrier is the acceptor of the hydride ion |CITS: [10548498]|, and the |FRAME: CPLX-5263| (E.C. 1.6.5.3), (also referred to as complex I), which couples oxidation of NAD(H) to the reduction of ubiquinone (and vice versa) |CITS: [12837548]|.
/
/The hydrolysis of NADP and NADPH in plants is carried out by corresponding phosphatases in dependence on the plant developmental stages and metabolic requirements. The |FRAME: MONOMER-11869| activity correlates with the dormancy state of |FRAME: TAX-4498| caryopses being involved in the maintenance of steady ratios of NADP and NADPH during seed imbibition, in spite of likewise increased NAD kinase activities |CITS: [10944152]|.
/
/While all of the processes and reactions mentioned so far are universal, the last two enzymes in this pathway have been described only in certain eukaryotic organisms. |FRAME: CPLX-7016| has been described only in green plants and several yeast species |CITS: [15347288][642063][ 642066]|, and |FRAME: MONOMER-11870| was described only in |FRAME: TAX-4577| |CITS: [16658848]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen
/species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as
/drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals
/|CITS: [VANBREUSGEM99][11997379]|. For example, active oxygen species are produced during the
/&beta;-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms |CITS: [8819328]|.
/ROS such as |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| and hydroxyl radicals as well as |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|
/can cause significant damage to proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles.
/
/Most of the aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to face oxidative stress and to scavenge
/oxidative radicals in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTMN-ENZRXN|
/(SOD) and |FRAME: HYDROPEROXIDI-ENZRXN| (CAT) |CITS: [BEYER87]|. For example, |FRAME: TAX-3702|, a member of the mustard family (oilseed plants), stores energy reserves preliminary
/as lipids that undergo &beta;-oxidation during germination. The |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| that is produced
/during this metabolic process is detoxified by catalase. Another form of ROS, |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals, are by-products of aerobic electron transfer chains, and are disposed of by the action of superoxide dismutase.
/Since ROS can be found in any compartment of the eukaryotic cell, organisms have developed small gene families
/encoding for several SOD and CAT enzymes that operate in the various cell compartments |CITS: [9765550][9214587]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/SODs represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals to
/|FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and water. SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor. There
/are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal
/cofactor but also in their subcellular location. In plants, FeSODs are located in chloroplasts and are regarded the
/most ancient SOD group. MnSODs are found in the mitochondrion and the peroxisome and are structurally very
/similar to FeSODs. The last group, the Cu-ZnSODs operates in chloroplasts, the cytosol and even the extracellular
/space. They are structurally very different from the other two SOD groups because of the different electrical properties
/of copper in comparison to iron or manganese, which resulted in a major structural change in the protein |CITS: [11997379]|.
/
/To date seven SODs have been identified in |FRAME: TAX-3702|, three of them iron-dependent, three having copper as
/metal cofactor and one manganese-dependent SOD |CITS: [1731963][2263641][9765550]|.
/It has been demonstrated that a copper-chaperone (AtCCS, At1g12520) is crucial for the activation of all three
/Cu/Zn-dependent SODs in this organism. The SOD holoenzyme usually constitutes either a homodimer or a
/homotetramer. However, the exact composition of the SODs in Arabidopsis is currently not known and remains
/to be verified (here displayed as polypeptides).
/
/Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen, converting |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|
/into water and oxygen. Three genes encoding subunits of catalase and at least 6 catalase isoenzymes have
/been identified in Arabidopsis so far |CITS: [12232134][9214587][8819328][8668130]|. Besides their
/implication in detoxifying ROS, catalases are thought to play a role in the signal transduction pathway in plants
/leading to the development of SAR (systemic aquired resistance) |CITS: [7953568]|. The functional protein of
/catalase is a tetramer but the question whether it exists as homo- or heterotetramer of different subunits remains
/to be investigated.

/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamine diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.

/Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The thiamine biosynthesis pathway illustrated here has been most extensively studied in the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| and the plant |FRAME: ORG-5993|.
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-P "Thiamine phosphate"| is formed by the coupling of two moieties, the pyrimidine |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| and the thiazole |FRAME: THZ-P|, which are produced by two different pathways. In eukaryotes |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| is first dephosphorylated into|FRAME: THIAMINE|, which is diphosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|, the activive form of thiamine.
/
/The occurrence of thiamine triphosphate in plants has also been demonstrated; however the physiological function of that compound remains to be shown |CITS:[12943234]|.
/
/While many of the enzymes involved in eukaryotic thiamine biosynthesis have been identified, most of the enzymes have not been extensively characterized at a biochemical level. Moreover, several steps in the pathway require further clarification. For example, the source of the sulfur in thiazole has not been identified, and the gene encoding the putative TMP phosphatase has not been discovered.
/
/The subcellular compartmentalization of thiamine biosynthesis is also a subject of on-going investigation. The Arabidopsis proteins TH1, ThiC, and TH1 all localize to the chloroplasts |CITS:[18048325][18332905][17174261][11575719]|, but THI1 can also localize to the mitochondria |CITS:[11575719]|. The downstream TPK1 and TPK2 enzymes are both cytosolic in Arabidopsis |CITS:[17611796]|, suggesting that intermediates in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway may need to be transported out of organelles for |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| synthesis to be completed. In addition,
/because TPP is used as a cofactor for enzymes present in different organelles, TPP transporters likely exist as well |CITS:[17611796]|.

COMMON-NAME - glutamate removal from folates
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. 
/
/During folate biosynthesis the enzyme |FRAME:EC-6.3.2.12|, adds an |FRAME:GLT| residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: THF| (tetrahydrofolate, H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF) (see |FRAME: FOLSYN-PWY|). THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]| (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|).
/
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of |FRAME:GLT| residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates) (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|). Most of the glutamate residues are added by &gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are different from the more common &alpha;-carboxyl-linked amide bonds, they are not hydrolyzed by most peptidases or proteases. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As vertebrates are not able to synthesize folate <i>in vivo</i>, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) and |FRAME: FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.
/
/In animals, during the absorption of food folates, which are usually polyglutamylated, the folate derivatives are hydrolyzed to a mono-glutamate level prior to transport by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.4.19.9|. The monoglutamylated forms are then metabolized within the enterocyte into |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF|. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13|, to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).
/
/&gamma;-Glutamyl hydrolases were characterized from multiple sources, and exhibit either endo- or exopeptidase activity, depending on the organism and tissue of origin |CITS: [6547136]|. In mammals they are often lysosomal with an acidic pH optimum |CITS: [2174100]|.  The enzyme is often sulfhydryl and zinc dependent |CITS: [2867095][2341911]|, may be heavily glycosylated |CITS: [1150668][8343522]|, and has molecular mass between 50 and 150 kDa.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Lutein is a xanthophyll carotenoid abundant in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, but also
/found in other organisms.
/Lutein is used as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption. In some fruits and flowers, such as marigolds
/lutein is covalently bound to one or more fatty acids.
/In animals lutein is found in egg yolks, fats and the corpus luteum (endocrine structure in mammals,
/involved in the production of the progestogens during pregnancy). It is also found in a concentrated area
/of the macula, a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.
/
/Lutein is produced from |FRAME: CPD1F-115| in three steps via |FRAME: CPD1F-118| and
/|FRAME: CPD-5661|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: LEU| is one of the three main branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with |FRAME: ILE|
/and |FRAME:VAL|.
/The catabolic pathways of the BCAAs can be divided into two sequential series of reactions, referred to
/as the common pathway and the distal pathway.
/
/The common pathway includes the enzymes |FRAME: CPLX-6941|, |FRAME: CPLX-6940|, and
/|FRAME: CPLX-6942|. These three enzymes catalyze the conversion of all three BCAAs to their
/respective acyl-CoA derivatives
/(|FRAME:METHACRYLYL-COA|, |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, and |FRAME: CPD-1083|
/for |FRAME:VAL|, |FRAME:LEU|, and |FRAME:ILE|, respectively), though the intermediates formed
/by these enzymes are different for the different amino acids.
/The distal parts of the pathways are completely different for the three BCAAs, and comprise enzymes
/specific for each amino acid |CITS: [773366]|.
/
/This Leucine degradation pathway is wide spread, and is found in microorganisms, higher plants, and
/animals, including mammals.
/
/The catabolism of |FRAME: LEU| begins with its transamination to |FRAME:2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE|,
/followed by oxidative decarboxylation to |FRAME:ISOVALERYL-COA|.
/|FRAME:ISOVALERYL-COA| then undergoes a four-step process, involving
/dehydrogenation to |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, carboxylation to
/|FRAME:TRANS-3-METHYL-GLUTACONYL-COA|, hydration to
/|FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-3-METHYL-GLUTARYL-COA|, and finally a thioester hydrolysis
/forming |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME:3-KETOBUTYRATE| |CITS: [4150714]|.
/Leucine degradation is different from the degradation of the other branched-chain amino acids, in that it
/includes a carboxylation step. The |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| fixing enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX66-17|,
/requires a biotin cofactor.
/
/In adipocytes, unlike other tissues, leucine is a significant precursor for fatty acid and sterol
/biosynthesis, especially in the presence of glucose |CITS: [13892210]|.  Furthermore, leucine apparently
/serves as a source of nitrogen for synthesis of |FRAME: GLN| and, to lesser extents, |FRAME: GLT|
/and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, which are released by adipocytes |CITS: [6773935]| and can serve as
/substrates for gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney |CITS: [6304077]|.
/
/It should be mentioned that alternative leucine degradation pathways exist. In one such pathway, 
/documented in |FRAME: TAX-1509|, leucine is degraded to |FRAME:ISOBUTYRATE| and
/|FRAME: ACET| via |FRAME:CPD-2041| (see |FRAME:PWY-5075|).  Additional pathways which are currently not characterized very well include the conversion
/of leucine to |FRAME: ACETONE| by members of the |FRAME:TAX-662| family |CITS: [10601206]|, and the
/catabolism of leucine to branched-chain fatty acids in |FRAME: TAX-1288| |CITS: [15078537]|.
/
/A portion of this leucine degradation pathway also participates in the final phase of the acyclic terpene utilization pathway, beginning at |FRAME: 3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA| as shown in the pathway link from |FRAME: PWY-6672|.  The acyclic terpene utilization pathway includes pathways |FRAME: PWY-6670|, |FRAME: PWY-6672| and this pathway, with its associated pathway link to |FRAME: ACETOACETATE-DEG-PWY|.  In species of |FRAME:TAX-286| the enzymes of |FRAME: LEU|/|FRAME: ISOVALERATE| utilization are encoded in the <i>liuRABCDE</i> gene cluster (reviewed in |CITS: [20490788]|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/L-Rhamnose is a component of the plant cell wall pectic polysaccharides rhamnogalacturonan I and rhamnogalacturonan II and is also present in diverse secondary metabolites including anthocyanins, flavonoids and triterpenoids.
/Rhamnosyl transferases have been shown to utilize UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose as the donor substrate |CITS: [1939145 ], [15020741]|, although in mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), both dTDP-&beta;-L-Rhamnose and UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose were reported to act as sugar donors for the rhamnosylation of flavonoids |CITS: [13864832 ]|.
/In general UDP-D-glucose is used in plants rather than dTDP-D-glucose as a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of L-rhamnose.
/
/L-Rhamnose residues have also been reported to be present in fungal glycoproteins, exopolysaccharides, and the cell wall, although their physiological role remains to be fully elucidated |CITS: [22102281][19496815][12423948]|. Genes encoding a UDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, and a bifunctional UDP-L-rhamnose synthase with 3,5-epimerase/-4-reductase activities have been identified in the fungal plant pathogens |FRAME: TAX-318829| (referred to in |CITS: [22102281]| as "<i>Magnaporthe grisea (Magnaporthe oryzae)</i>") and |FRAME: TAX-40559| |CITS: [22102281]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The |FRAME: TAX-3702| genome contains three similar genes that were named |FRAME: AT1G78570|, |FRAME: AT1G53500| and |FRAME: AT3G14790|. All three genes encode trifunctional proteins that catalyze the three reactions that are required to convert |FRAME: CPD-12575| to |FRAME: UDP-L-RHAMNOSE|: UDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase; UDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3,5-epimerase; and UDP-4-dehydro-L-rhamnose 4-reductase.
/
/Functional domain analysis showed that the N-terminal region of these proteins is responsible for the first activity, while the C-terminal region carries out the two following activities. Mutations in |FRAME: AT1G53500| resulted in mucilage defects in seeds, due to defficiency of rhamnogalactan.
/
/All three genes were expressed in protease-deficient |FRAME: TAX-4932| yeast cells, and assays performed with the cytoplasmic fraction of the recombinant yeast cells have shown that all three enzymes are trifunctional and catalyze all three functions |CITS: [17190829]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/This route of |FRAME: CYS| degradation is shared among bacteria and eukaryotes.  Additional mammalian pathways are shown in |FRAME: CYSTEINE-DEG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5329|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562|, L-cysteine degradation is carried out by L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity (CD) |CITS: [9572924]|. CD is known to catalyze the degradation of |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, |FRAME: AMMONIA|, and |FRAME: HS| |CITS: [14907623][13271322][12883870][16000837]|. In |FRAME:TAX-562|, cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), primarily catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE| to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [7049234]| while tryptophanase (TnaA) mainly degrades |FRAME: TRP| to |FRAME: INDOLE|, |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [14171448]|. Both of them have been shown to exhibit CD activity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [704923][1428472][12883870]|.  
/
/It was recently found that in addition to tryptophanase (TnaA) and cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), three additional proteins exhibit the PLP-dependent-L-cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) activity. These are OAS sulfhydrylase A (CysK), OAS sulfhydrylase B (CysM), and the MalY protein. CysK primarily catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: CYS| from |FRAME: ACETYLSERINE| and |FRAME: HS| along the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway (|FRAME: CYSTSYN-PWY|). CysM is considered to be an isomer of CysK with unidentified function. MalY protein has activity of the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (&beta; C-S lyase) of |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE|. The gene disruption for each protein significantly decreases the CD activity and is effective for overproduction of |FRAME: CYS|. The decrease in CD activity for all these genes disruption is reversed in the presence of |FRAME: CYS| except for the <i>tnaA</i> gene disruption. This result suggests that TnaA is a key enzyme in |FRAME: CYS| degradation in |FRAME:TAX-562|. Disruption of all the <i>tnaA</i>, <i>metC</i>, <i>cysK</i>, <i>cysM</i> and <i>malY</i> genes together also show much higher CD activity in the presence of |FRAME: CYS| than in its absence |CITS: [16000837][16820466]|. Unidentified proteins with CD activity are found, which may be induced by L-cysteine.
/
/Amino acids, |FRAME: TRP|, |FRAME: GLT|, and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| inhibit the CD activity in |FRAME:TAX-562|. |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, which is most similar to |FRAME: CYS| in configuration, shows the greatest amount of inhibition. Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (|FRAME: TRIS|), an effective carbonyl agent also caused significant inhibition to the CD activity |CITS: [13271322]|.

CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: Phosphoinositides "Phosphoinositides"| play a key role in signal transduction in the eukaryotic cell, transmitting signals from the cell surface to modulate intracellular processes. One well known phosphoinositide pathway produces the secondary messengers |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| and |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "diacylglycerol"| and is described in |FRAME: PWY-6351|.
/
/The 3-phosphoinositide pathway described here is another one of the major pathways of intracellular signal transduction. At the center of this pathway are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), enzymes that produce the monophosphate |FRAME: CPD-177 "phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate"|, the bisphosphate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-34-BISPH "phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate"| and the trisphosphate |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-345-TRIPHOSPHATE "phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate"|, all important compounds in 
/signaling cascades that influences a wide variety of cellular functions.
/
/The 3-phosphoinositide pathway has been implicated in growth factor-dependent mitogenesis, membrane ruffling and glucose uptake, cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, cell survival, cell migration, and intracellular protein trafficking. |CITS: [8086005]|. Some of the products of the PI 3-kinases, namely  |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-34-BISPH "phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate"| and the trisphosphate |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-345-TRIPHOSPHATE "phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate"|, are almost absent in quiescent cells but are produced rapidly upon stimulation by a variety of factors, suggesting a likely function as second messengers. In addition, these compounds do not seem to be substrates for phospholipases C |CITS: [2553693]|, and it has been proposed that they may act via the activation of certain protein kinases such as Akt/RAC/PKB and certain protein kinase C isoforms |CITS: [ 8181054][7798235]|.
/
/
/The enzymes responsible for the generation of 3' phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, have been assigned to three classes based on structural similarity, substrate specificity, and probable mechanism of activation |CITS: [9247130]|. 
/
/Class I is composed of heterodimeric enzymes, each containing one catalytic subunit, encoded by |FRAME: HS04527|, |FRAME: HS00644|, |FRAME: HS02818| or |FRAME: HS10353|, and one regulatory subunit, encoded by |FRAME: HS07270|, |FRAME: HS02779|, |FRAME: HS04135|, |FRAME: HS13887| or |FRAME: HS16294|. Even though all class I enzymes can phosphorylate <i>in vitro</i> |FRAME:L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols "phosphatidylinositol"|, |FRAME: CPD-1108| and |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, only the later is beleived to be the <i>in vivo</i> substrate (|FRAME:2.7.1.153-RXN "EC 2.7.1.153"|).
/
/Class II enzymes are monomeric proteins that are distinguished by a carboxy-terminal C2 (CalB) |FRAME: CA+2|-binding domain |CITS: [9632630]|, and are encoded by |FRAME: HS00315|, |FRAME: HS05725| and |FRAME: HS06583|. They accept several types of substrates, and are the only mammalian enzyme thought to catalyze |FRAME:2.7.1.154-RXN "EC 2.7.1.154"|. 
/
/Class III enzymes are heterodimeric, composed of a catalytic subunit (|FRAME: HS01275|) and a regulatory subunit (|FRAME: HS03788|). These enzymes, which are homologs of the yeast Vps34p protein, can only phosphorylate |FRAME:L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols| (|FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.137"|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The detoxification of the highly toxic formaldehyde is a major biochemical necessity for most life forms. In the case of methylotrophic bacteria, formaldehyde is not just a toxic compound, but also a central intermediate.
/It has been suggested that the formaldehyde concentration in the cytoplasm of a methylotroph would rise to 100mM in less than 1 minute if formaldehyde consumption would stop |CITS: [11073907]|. Several different pathways for |FRAME: Formaldehyde-Oxidation| are known in bacteria, encoded by unrelated or distantly related genes.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Perhaps the best characterized is the pathway involving |FRAME:CPLX-3381| (GSH-FDH) and |FRAME:CPLX-3404| (FGH). GSH-FDH enzymes are a well studied class of the alcohol dehydrogenase protein family (class III ADH )
/|CITS: [ 1872853]| that have been discovered in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Unlike many alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, GSH-FDH do not exhibit appreciable activity with short aliphatic alcohols. Instead, GSH-FDH enzymes catalyze the NAD-dependent oxidation of long-chain alcohols or hydroxylated fatty acids.
/Specifically, |FRAME:S-HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTATHIONE| (HMGSH), an adduct formed spontaneously by glutathione (GSH) and formaldehyde (HCHO) , is both the preferred <i>in vitro</i> and presumed <i>in vivo</i> substrate for GSHFDH enzymes.
/Even though it is formed spontaneously, in certain bacteria  |FRAME: S-HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTATHIONE| production is accelerated by a dedicated enzyme, |FRAME:CPLX-3403| |CITS: [8631716][8892832][11173978][12904537][7798140][12196016]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The three aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine are all derived from a common 
/precursor chorismate. In tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis, chorismate is first converted to an 
/intermediate prephenate.  There are two possible routes to synthesize phenylalanine or tyrosine from 
/the intermediate prephenate: 1) via arogenate by the activity of prephenate aminotransferase, illustrated 
/here, or 2) via phenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydratase for phenylalanine synthesis, or 
/via hydroxyphenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydrogenase for tyrosine synthesis.
/The latter route has been confirmed in many microorganisms 
/including E.coli and yeast. In fact, the two alternative routes have been reported co-exist in 
/microorganisms. However, compiling evidence suggests that many plants may only employ the 
/arogenate route for phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis. There is so far no sound evidence support the 
/other route in plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The phytyl chain is an essential component in the structure of diverse prenyllipids such as chlorophylls, tocopherols and phylloquinone |CITS:[9492312]|.  The phytyl chain allows for the insertion of those compounds into the hydrophobic core of membranes such as the plastid membrane of chloroplasts and etioplasts.  To date, two pathways of prenylation have been described:
/
/a) The first pathway concerns the prenylation of chlorophyllide a with |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| (GGPP) to form |FRAME: CPD-7005|, which is subsequently converted through several successive steps of reduction to form |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| (see |FRAME:PWY-5064|).
/
/b) In the second pathway (this pathway) free |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| is converted to |FRAME: PHYTYL-PYROPHOSPHATE|, which is then prenylated to |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A| to form |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|. 
/
/The former route was detected in plant etioplasts |CITS:[7408876]|, whilst the second was reported in chloroplasts, where the biosynthesis of tocopherol |CITS:[7447462]| and phylloquinone |CITS:[7274213]| also utilizes preformed |FRAME: PHYTYL-PYROPHOSPHATE|. 
/
/<b>Enzyme Information:</b>
/
/In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> a multifunctional enzyme was shown to be able to catalyze the multiple reduction steps in both routes: |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| to |FRAME: PHYTYL-PYROPHOSPHATE| as well as |FRAME: CPD-7005| to |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| |CITS:[9492312]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Strigolactones Strigolactones| are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635 "<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (cotton)"| infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provide the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interaction between the fungi and the roots.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Although the involvement of several dioxygenases in the pathway has been found earlier, full understanding of the earlier steps of the pathway leading to strigolactones biosynthesis was obtained only in 2012 |CITS: [22422982]|. The first committed step is catalyzed by a |FRAME: MONOMER-17611|, which converts the <i>all-trans</i> version of &beta;-carotene to |FRAME: CPD-14646|. A dioxygenase, encoded by the |FRAME: AT2G44990| gene, cleaves this molecule between the 10' and 9' positions, producing |FRAME: CPD-14647| (and releasing |FRAME: CPD-7204|).
/The key enzyme of the pathway, encoded by the |FRAME: AT4G32810| gene, catalyzes a complex reaction that involves the incorporation of two oxygen molecules and complete rearrangement, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-14649|, a precursor of strigolactones that already contains some of the important structural features |CITS: [22422982]|. 
/
/While the later steps of the pathway are not known yet, it has been proposed that only two additional steps may be necessary to obtain the synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-14652| |CITS: [22422982]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in any biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE Putrescine| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|). While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis, recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860] [14738999]|.  In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time |CITS: [11537482]|. In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism |CITS:[3157043]|.  In the hyperthermophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-69014| both this pathway and pathway |FRAME:PWY-6834| may lead to the synthesis of longer chain polyamines, with the latter pathway being the main route |CITS: [20675472]|.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-4932| the pathway is realized via the ODC pathway. |FRAME:SPERMIDINE Spermidine| is formed by |FRAME:YPR069C-MONOMER| which has been characterized through the complementation of a mutant strain (&Delta;spe3). It has been demonstrated that |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| was absolutely necessary for such mutants to restore wild-type growth and sporulation |CITS:[9073064]|. The null mutant &Delta;spe3 accumulates |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| which is an activator of |FRAME:CPLX3O-10520| providing the propylamine moiety necessary to form |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| |CITS:[11526206]|. The formed other product of the reaction |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE| is not only a strong competitive inhibitor for the |FRAME:CPLX3O-10520| but is poisonous for yeast when accumulating in &Delta;spe3 mutants |CITS:[9073064]|.
/
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE Spermidine| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed |FRAME: CPLX-6907|. The source of the propylamine group is decarboxylated |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|) which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6906|. The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

CITATIONS - PMNCVP2017:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>Background</b>
/
/In this pathway chorismate is synthesized from |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|. The pathway is found in prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. However, it's starting point, |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|, can be synthesized in different routes. In most microorganisms it is synthesized from |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6164|), but the methanogens of the |FRAME: TAX-28890| phylum utilize an alternative route |CITS: [15182204]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6160|). 
/
/|FRAME: CHORISMATE "Chorismate"| is an intermediate in the synthesis of the three aromatic amino acids: |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. These amino acids serve as substrates in other pathways for secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, lignin, coumarin, indole derivatives and other phenolic compounds |CITS: [22296303]|. 
/
/|FRAME: SHIKIMATE "Shikimate"| is an important intermediate in the chorismate biosynthetic pathway. It was first isolated from Japanese star anise. Shikimate is used for the production of some antiviral drugs used to halt the spread of the flu virus, but as a biosynthetic intermediate, it is usually not found in high concentrations in organisms. Shikimate can be easily harvested from the needles of several species of pine trees, and biosynthetic pathways in |FRAME:TAX-562| have been enhanced to obtain sufficient amounts of the metabolite for commercial use.  
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHP synthase) catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| to form |FRAME: 3-DEOXY-D-ARABINO-HEPTULOSONATE-7-P| (DAHP). It is a crucial enzyme that controls flux through the chorismate pathway in plants |CITS: [22296303]|. Three different isoforms of the enzyme encoded by <i>aroF, aroG</i> and <i>aroH</i> are expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562| and these enzymes are subject to feedback inhibition by the aromatic amino acids produced |CITS: [4884590]|.
/
/|FRAME: AROB-MONOMER| catalyzes the transformation of DAHP to |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE| (DHQ). While this reaction requires NAD as a cofactor, there is no net use of NAD as the reaction regenerates it. |FRAME: AROD-CPLX| hydrolyzes DHQ to |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE| which is subsequently reduced to shikimate by |FRAME: AROE-MONOMER|. Shikimate kinase catalyzes the fifth reaction in chorismate biosynthesis. The kinase forms a complex with the bifunctional DAHP synthase-chorismate mutase enzyme. The complex may serve as a regulatory unit |CITS: [170268] [BSUB225]|.
/
/5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase catalyzes the penultimate step in chorismate biosynthesis. The synthase is activated by ammonium ions and exhibits allosteric behavior. Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine) acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to PEP and as a partial uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to shikimate 3-P |CITS: [3111378] [7744055][7589547]|.
/
/Chorismate synthase acts in the shikimate pathway. It catalyses the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate into chorismate, the key branch-point intermediate in aromatic biosynthesis.

COMMON-NAME - glycolysis I (from glucose 6-phosphate)
CITATIONS - PMNIC2017:EV-IC
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the major pathways of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA "TCA cycle"|. Glycolysis is essential under all conditions of growth, because it produces six of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules (the six compounds are |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|). Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.
/
/Even though glycolysis is often described starting with glucose, other hexoses (e.g. fructose) can also serve as input (as its name implies - glycose is a general term for simple sugars).
/
/Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:
/
/i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
/
/ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
/This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway diagram describes the well characterized glycolysis pathway of the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| growing with |FRAME: GLC| as a source of carbon and energy. Glucose is not shown here as a component of glycolysis because
/when used by |FRAME: TAX-562| , glucose enters the cell via a phosphotransferase system (transport of glucose,
/|FRAME: CPLX-157|), and the first intracellular species, therefore, is |FRAME: GLC-6-P|.
/
/|FRAME:TAX-562| does constitutively produce |FRAME:GLUCOKIN-MONOMER| (the intracellular enzyme that converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate) but it is not needed for the utilization of either exogenous or endogenous glucose |CITS: [9023215]|. It may be required to supplement levels of glucose 6-phosphate under anabolic stress conditions |CITS: [7786044]|.
/
/Other substrates may enter glycolysis at different stages. For example, the sugars and sugar alcohols |FRAME:ALLOSE|, |FRAME:SORBOSE|, |FRAME:MANNITOL|, |FRAME:SORBITOL|, |FRAME:MANNOSE| and |FRAME:SUCROSE|, which are processed into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|, enter the pathway at that stage (see |FRAME: PWY-5484|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|. They are also found in some non-photosynthetic bacteria, such as some strains of |FRAME: TAX-53335| and |FRAME: TAX-29| |CITS:[4340261][2254247][1946693]|. Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.
/These isoprenoids pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against 
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments; light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided in two major groups: carotenes and xanthophylls. Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene. Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy, keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein and zeaxanthin. The carotenoid composition varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly, developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210][8485401]|. Important carotenoids variations are observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|). Higher plant chloroplasts typically accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound photosystems |CITS:[1885603][Ryberg93]|. &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[Young93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found |CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin) |CITS:[1885603][8444169]|. In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Carotenes are oxygenated in various ways (hydroxylation, epoxydation, de-epoxidation) to form xanthophylls, which comprise most of the carotenoid pigments in the thylakoid membranes. Hydroxylations play an important role in the oxygenation of carotenes and are catalyzed by hydroxylases acting specifically onto &beta; or &epsilon; rings.
/
/|FRAME: CPD1F-130| is one of the most common carotenoid alcohols found in nature. It is the pigment that gives corn, saffron, and many other plants their characteristic color. Zeaxanthin breaks down to form |FRAME: CPD-8668| and |FRAME: CPD-8669|, which are responsible for the taste and aroma of saffron. Mono- and di-glucosylated forms of zeaxanthin are found in some strains of |FRAME: TAX-53335|, namely |FRAME: TAX-549| and |FRAME: TAX-553| |CITS: [1946693][2254247]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamine diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamine-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Thiamine biosynthesis is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6893|).

/This pathway describes the last part of the thiamine biosynthesis pathway in |FRAME: TAX-1280| - the coupling of the two moieties of thiamine, the thiazole and the pyrimidine, forming |FRAME: THIAMINE-P|, and its phosphorylation to the biologically active form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.
/
/While most bacteria achieve this phosphorylation in a single step, catalyzed by |FRAME: THI-P-KIN-MONOMER| (|FRAME: G6234|) (see |FRAME: PWY-6893|), eukaryotes lack that enzyme and instead utilize a pathway where |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| is first dephosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE|, which is then diphosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| (see |FRAME: THISYNARA-PWY|) |CITS: [19888457]|.

/
/The next step, |FRAME: AT4G29530-MONOMER "Thiamine phosphate phosphatase"|, has been detected in partially purified Arabidopsis extracts, and was associated with a low molecular weight (~10 kD) protein |CITS: [16666289]|. However, the exact identity of this enzyme is still not known.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate |CITS: [12633501]|. A variation of the pathway found in some archaebacteria and hyperthermophilic bacteria utilizes a dedicated carrier protein to protect the intermediates instead of acetylation.
/
/Several alternative arginine biosynthetic pathways have evolved in bacteria:
/
/In |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY|, which is not very common, the key intermediate |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.1|. A second key intermediate downstream, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|, is hydrolyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.16|, releasing acetate, and forming the arginine precursor |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|.
/
/In |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions mentioned above are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto glutamate, regenerating  |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).
/This recycling is performed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.35|. This pathway is considered more evolved, since the overall reaction is energetically more favorable |CITS: [3534538]|.
/
/The variant |FRAME: PWY-5154| is found in several eubacteria. While in the two pathways mentioned above |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is deacetylate to |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, which is subsequntly transcarbamoylated to form |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE|, in this variant |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is not deacetylated. Instead, it is
/transcarbamoylated directly by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.1.3.9|, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7224|. The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX| can accept |FRAME: CPD-7224| as a substrate, and deacetylates it into |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| |CITS: [16585758]|.
/
/The variant |FRAME: PWY-7400|, which has been described in the archaebacterium |FRAME: TAX-2285|, involves early intermediates that are protected not by acetylation but by a carrier protein (the LysW |FRAME: LysW|), which participates in the biosynthesis of both |FRAME: ARG| and |FRAME: LEU| in these organsims |CITS: [23434852]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes |FRAME:TAX-186817|, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as |FRAME:TAX-4932|, |FRAME:TAX-5140| sp., and |FRAME:TAX-3052| sp.
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway possess the <i>argJ</i> gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from <i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-ornithine to glutamate,  generating ornithine and <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the latter is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by <i>argB</i>), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway  |CITS: [JGM138-125][8025667]|.
/While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by <i>argA</i>), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division |CITS: [12633501]|.
/
/In some bacteria, such as <i>Bacillus</i> sp. |CITS: [8473852 ]|, <i>Nisseria gonorrhoeae</i> |CITS: [1339419]|, |FRAME:TAX-2337| |CITS: [10931207]| and in yeast (|FRAME:TAX-4932|) |CITS: [9428669]|, OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either <i>N</i>-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG.  <i>argJ</i> genes from such organisms can complement both <i>argE</i> and <i>argA</i> mutations in |FRAME:TAX-562|. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by <i>argA</i> genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated |CITS: [12633501]|.
/
/<b>Additional yeast-specific info from the |FRAME:TAX-4930| Genome Database:</b>
/
/The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> take place in the mitochondrion
/|CITS: [11553611][Hinnebusch]|. This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the
/acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
/generated in the fifth step.
/The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated
/into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
/kinase and <i>N</i>-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase |CITS: [1649049]|.
/These enzymes form a complex with each other and with <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the
/pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity |CITS: [11553611]|.
/The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported
/to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p |CITS: [8798783]|. In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to
/L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and
/argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino
/acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid
/starvation |CITS: [11390663][Hinnebusch]|. Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also
/repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p,
/and Mcm1p |CITS: [14563547]|. The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p
/repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability |CITS: [15289616]|.

/The term |FRAME: Vitamin-E| (tocochromenols) is a collective term for the eight forms of |FRAME: Tocotrienols tocotrienols| and |FRAME: Tocopherols tocopherols|, each existing as &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species.
/
/Structurally tocotrienols and tocopherols differ only in the degree of unsaturation of their side-chain.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) can occur via two distinct routes: the |FRAME: PWY-922 "mevalonate pathway"| (MVA pathway) and the |FRAME:PWY-7560 "methylerythritol phosphate pathway"| (MEP pathway, this pathway) |CITS: [11078528]|. In the former, IPP is synthesized from the condensation of  three acetyl-CoA molecules; in the MEP pathway IPP is synthesized via the condensation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|.
/
/For many years, the MVA pathway was considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms. However, several inconsistencies led to the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.
/In plants the MVA pathway is located in the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS:[LICHTENTHALER97]|. The MEP pathway is present in most eubacteria, unicellular green algae, the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms and some unicellular eukaryotes related to photosynthetic phyla, such as the Plasmodium parasites |CITS: [15473867]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP "Isopentenyl diphosphate"| (IPP) and its isomer |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are produced from |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via this pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DOXP). DOXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, |FRAME: 2-C-METHYL-D-ERYTHRITOL-4-PHOSPHATE| (MEP). 
/Interestingly, two rather different enzymes, that share no sequence homology, are able to catalyze this reaction - the |FRAME: DXPREDISOM-CPLX "DXR"| enzymes, and the |FRAME:MONOMER-15827 "DRL"| (DXR-like) enzymes |CITS: [20660776]|.
/
/In the third reaction MEP is converted into |FRAME: 4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C|, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding
/|FRAME: 2-PHOSPHO-4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C-MET|. This product is then converted into
/|FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. Subsequently, it is reduced to generate |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| |CITS: [12198182]|.
/
/This diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP in the final step. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER|. IPP and DMAPP serve as the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  
/
/The difference between this pathway variant and the bacterial variant described in |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| is the conversion of |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| to |FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. In this variant, that enzyme utilizes ferredoxin as the electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.1|), while in the other variant the enzyme utilizes flavodoxin (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.3|).
/
/This pathway, which is not present in humans, is involved in production of phosphate-containing antigens recognized by &gamma;-&delta; T lymphocytes |CITS: [11675382]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, mono- or diphosphorylated forms of pyrimidine nucleotides activate other molecules, as in |FRAME: CMP-KDO|, |FRAME: CPD-12575|, and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways of pyrimidine nucleotides consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. Salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides, and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways to form other nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|).However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level. These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (uridine 5'-monophosphate), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).
/
/The first enzyme, |FRAME: EC-6.3.5.5|, forms |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is not only an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis but also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as |FRAME: ARG|, |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| and |FRAME: CANAVANINE|. The pathway continues with the condensation of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| |CITS: [8041358]|. The products is cyclized to
/|FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE|, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring.
/
/The next step, the oxidation of |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| to |FRAME: OROTATE| is carried out by different enzymes in different organisms. In general, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi contain class 1  enzymes, which are cytosolic, include |FRAME: FMN| cofators, and use |FRAME: FUM| or NAD(P)+ as electron acceptors (|FRAME: EC-1.3.98.1|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.14|, or |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.15|). Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes possess class 2 enzymes, which are membrane bound and use |FRAME: Quinones| as electron acceptor (|FRAME: EC-1.3.5.2 "EC 1.3.5.2"|) |CITS: [Jensen98]|.
/
/The final two steps, the condensation of |FRAME: OROTATE| with PRPP forming |FRAME: OROTIDINE-5-PHOSPHATE|
/(OMP) followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.10|
/and |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.23|. The last step is considered the rate-limiting step of the overall <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [7579161]|.
/
/In plants, the two initial enzymatic reactions of this pathway occur in the plastids, while all of the remaining reactions occur in the cytosol and mitochondria |CITS: [22474184]|. This implies that |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| must be exported from the plastids. A plastidic nucleobase transporter specific for uracil (a precursor for pyrimidine salvage pathways) has been reported |CITS: [22474184]|. Since the reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: DIHYDROOROTOX-MONOMER "dihydroorotate dehydrogenase"| occurs in the mitochondria, transporters for both |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| and |FRAME: OROTATE| must exist, although they have not been identified yet.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
/as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. Although the enzymatic steps in this pathway are conserved throughout all organisms (with the exception of the oxidation of |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| to |FRAME: OROTATE|), some differences in the enzymes do exist. For example, in plants and bacteria the three steps leading from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| to |FRAME: OROTATE| are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by the single multifunctional |FRAME: CPLX-6703| |CITS: [8619816]|.
/Similarly, the last two steps of the pathway are carried out by a bi-functional enzyme (|FRAME: AT3G54470-MONOMER|) in plants and animals |CITS: [2876681][7579161][9878395]| whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for that purpose.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Vitamins-B6 Vitamin B6| is a group term for |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| (PL), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| (PN), |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| (PM) and their 5'-phosphorylated derivatives |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| (PLP), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| (PNP) and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP), which are also referred to as vitamers. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has recently been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|.  Most bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.
/
/PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. In humans this vitamin has a role in numerous functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to potent antioxidant activity.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The reaction is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-8031|, a dimeric complex that includes two different subunits |CITS: [16030023]|. The |FRAME: MONOMER-15503 "glutamine hydrolase"| subunit (encoded by |FRAME: G-11883|) catalyzes the hydrolysis of |FRAME: GLN|, producing |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [14585832]|. The ammonia is not released from the enzyme - instead, it is channeled to the active site of the |FRAME: MONOMER-15502 "synthase subunit"| (|FRAME: G-11882|) by a 100&Aring; tunnel.
/
/The synthase subunit (Pdx1, |FRAME: G-11882|) condenses the ammonium with |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: GAP| in a complex series of reactions and produces |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| |CITS: [18271580]|.
/
/The purified proteins have been used <i>in vitro</i> in a reconstituted system |CITS: [15771487]|, and a detailed model for the enzyme's mechanism has been suggested |CITS: [17189272][18271580][18260082][18516049]|.
/
/The formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| in |FRAME:TAX-4932| also happens independent of |FRAME:DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DXP). The |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase complex consists of two subunits, i.e. |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase encoded by SNZ1 catalyzing the final formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| and a glutaminase encoded by SNO1 providing the |FRAME:AMMONIA| which is the source for the ring nitrogen. It has been demonstrated that the |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase not only catalyzes the final formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| but also carries out the isomerization of |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| to |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:RIBOSE-5P| to |FRAME:RIBULOSE-5P|, the latter being the preferred substrates for the |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase. The enzyme has been crystallized and characterized with regard to structure and reaction sequence |CITS:[19523954] [20919991]|. The gene encoding the glutaminase, i.e. SNO1 has been demonstrated to only exhibit glutaminase activity when expressed in complex with SNZ1 |CITS:[14764090]|. From the 3 members in both the SNZ and SNO gene families only the pair SNZ1/SNO1 have been shown to be co-regulated and involved in vitamin B6 (|FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|) formation |CITS:[12271461] [12649274] [9791124]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The first purine nucleotide that is synthesized <i>de novo</i> is |FRAME: IMP| (IMP).
/IMP is converted to |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER|,
/and the later is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, |FRAME: AMP| (AMP), by the action of
/|FRAME:AMPSYN-ENZRXN|.
/
/AMP is phosphorylated to ADP and subsequently to ATP. The first reaction is catalyzed by
/|FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|. Reactions that convert ADP to ATP are numerous and found in multiple pathways, including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-cycle based aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis. However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: CPLX490-3510 ATP synthase| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes the proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP. This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.
/
/In some bacteria ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form (see |FRAME:PWY-7220|).
/
/Genetic studies indicate that in bacterial systems the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the |FRAME: PC00033| |CITS:[2404765]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Plant growth and development requires macro and micronutrients, some of which are available only from external sources like the soil in which they grow. Phosphorous is one such essential macronutrient, it is usually absorbed and utilized by the plants in the form of |FRAME: Pi| (also known as inorganic phosphate, or Pi) |CITS: [18713395]|. Many soils are deficient in |FRAME: Pi|, leading to |FRAME: Pi| starvation for plants growing in them. Plants develop several strategies to overcome |FRAME: Pi| limitation, including morphological, biochemical and physiological responses to enhance the acquisition of this vital macronutrient. These combined responses enhance the chances of plants to survive the prospects of |FRAME: Pi| starvation. Due to continous leaching, ancient soils are known to become limited in the availability of |FRAME: Pi|. 
/
/Once absorbed, the |FRAME: Pi| is utilized inside the cells at optimum cellular concentration for the various developmental and biochemical processes. Phosphate acquisition is a complicated process and has various modified routes. The |FRAME: Pi| homeostasis is maintained by acquisition, limited consumption and effective recycling, when the supply and demand is not equitable. The molecular basis for these strategies is being studied in a number of species |CITS: [19168668]|. The Gulf Ryegrass is an ideal model plant as it hyperaccumulates |FRAME: Pi| utilizing multiple acquisition and mobilization systems under varying |FRAME: Pi| regimes |CITS: [1882180]|. In some plants the chief enzymes that partcipate in the transport and recycling of |FRAME: Pi| are developmentally regulated |CITS: [12021284]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The  Purple Acid Phosphatases (PAP's) are said to play a role in |FRAME: Pi| salvaging when cells are depleted or starved of |FRAME: Pi| and under oxidative stress. Thus PAP's are crucial for the cellular metabolism and energy transduction processes. 
/PAP's have also been isolated from mammalian and fungal sources, although the physiological function of these enzymes has yet to be established |CITS: [10510276]|. Genes encoding such enzymes are also present in some bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but their role is not clear. It has been suggested that they prevent damage caused by generated by invaded host cells (mycobacteria) or by the light-harvesting complex (cyanobacteria) |CITS: [11024303]|. However, the enzyme of |FRAME: TAX-216591| is induced by lack of phosphate and excreted from the cell, suggesting it may be involved in phosphate acquisition |CITS: [19376213]|.
/
/The PAP enzymes may exist in two forms: the inactive purple form, where the redox-active iron is in the ferric state, and the active pink form, where the iron is reduced to the ferrous state.The PAP's are expressed in a tissue specific manner and often exist as isozymes |CITS: [16244908][15375722 ]|. The isozymes exhibit variation in molecular structure, substrate specficity and localization.
/
/Some PAP's, such as |FRAME: MONOMER-15162| from |FRAME: TAX-4081|, are multifunctional enzymes that have both a purple acid phosphatase and an alkaline peroxidase function. These enzymes are hypothesized to function in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) |CITS: [12473124]|. The phosphatase and oxygen radical-generating activities of PAP's are functionally independent, similar to those of mammalian PAP |CITS: [11890682]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes. A few bacterial species that were reported to contain |FRAME:SPERMINE| include |FRAME: TAX-287| |CITS:[4875413]| and |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS: [13538999]|.
/
/
/Unlike |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, |FRAME:SPERMINE| is not essential for viability in eukaryotes. Exogenous |FRAME:SPERMINE| supported growth of |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|-depleted cells only after its degradation into |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| |CITS: [kramer96]| and |FRAME:SPERMINE|-defficient transgenic mice, which were generated by eliminating the SpmS gene, located on the X chromosome, were viable |CITS: [ 9467015]|.  Although, the lack of |FRAME:SPERMINE| biosynthesis resulted in a phenotype in affected males that included symptoms of circling behavior, hyperactivity, head shaking, inner ear abnormalities, deafness, sterility, a profound postnatal growth retardation, and a propensity to sudden death. The symptoms were eliminated when the gene was overexpressed in the mice. These results showed that |FRAME:SPERMINE| synthesis is needed for normal growth, viability, and fertility in male mice |CITS: [15459188]|.

/In |FRAME:TAX-4932| the lack of |FRAME:YLR146C| had no obvious manifestation on the mutant phenotype and the homozygous &Delta;spe4 diploid cells sporulated normally indicating that |FRAME:SPERMINE| in yeast was not essential for growth and development. Hence, the role of |FRAME:SPERMINE| in yeast remains unclear and needs further research.

/
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed |FRAME: CPLX-6908|. The source of the propylamine group is decarboxylated |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|) which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6906|. The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN Cardiolipin| is an anionic membrane phospholipid. Along with |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol|, the anionic lipids are important for the biogenesis and function of membranes. Cardiolipin is present in the plasma membrane of bacteria and in the mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes.
/
/A main difference exists between bacterial and eukaryotic cardiolipin biosynthesis; In bacteria cardiolipin is formed by the condensation of two molecules of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol|, while in eukaryotes it is formed from one molecule of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL CDP-diacylglycerol|  and one molecule of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol|.
/
/In all eukaryotes, cardiolipin biosynthesis occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane |CITS: [15811335]|. In mung bean mitochondria, the |FRAME: MONOMER-12278| activity is much higher than the |FRAME: MONOMER-12277| activity, resulting in a quick turn over of phosphatidylglycerolphosphate to phosphatidylglycerol |CITS: [12232283]|. In fact, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate is not detected in mitochondrial membranes of mung beans.
/
/It is noteworthy that, in addition to being synthesized in mitochondria, phosphatidylglycerol may also be imported from the endoplasmic reticulum to serve as the cardiolipin precursor |CITS: [12609031]|.
/
/The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: MONOMER-12277| is the rate-limiting step of cardiolipin biosynthesis.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, derived from the common precursor 
/chorismate, are not only constituents of proteins but also precursors of many secondary metabolites found in plants. 
/There are two possible routes to synthesize phenylalanine from the intermediate prephenate: via arogenate by the 
/activity of prephenate aminotransferase or via phenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydratase. The 
/phenylpyruvate route has been confirmed in many microorganisms including E.coli and yeast. However, compiling 
/evidence suggests that many plants employ the arogenate route. There is so far no evidence for the phenylpyruvate 
/route in plants. Prephenate dehydratase has never been detected in any plants. Yet, the two alternative routes have 
/been reported co-exist in many microorganisms.
/
/Arogenate is the branch-point and the immediate precursor for the synthesis of both tyrosine and phenylalanine. 
/Arogenate dehydratase is the key enzyme channeling arogenate towards phenylalanine synthesis. Its activity is 
/strongly feedback inhibited by phenylalanine.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: STEARIC_ACID Stearate| is a saturated fatty acid that occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is an important constituent of milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1823, and its name comes from Greek for "hard fat", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid |CITS: [16477801]|.
/
/<i>De novo</i> plant fatty acid synthesis occurs primarily in plastids and chloroplasts (it was shown that at least in Arabidopsis fatty acid synthesis also occurs in the mitochondria). The process involves a series of reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS) complexes that provoke the condensation of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| and |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|).
/
/In animals the last [acp]-bound intermediate appears to be |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"|, and elongation to |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| proceeds via CoA-bound intermediates in the ER (see |FRAME: PWY-5972|). In bacteria and plants elongation to stearate appears to continue via [acp]-bound intermediates, and |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| has been detected in many species |CITS: [4831331]|. 
/At least in plants, the elongation from |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"| to |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| is catalyzed by a dedicated &beta;-ketoacyl-[acp] synthase, encoded by |FRAME: G-10790| (The enzyme involved in <i>de novo</i> fatty acid synthesis system up to |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs "palmitoyl-[acp]"| is encoded by |FRAME: AT5G46290|) |CITS: [4153356][11337402]|.
/
/|FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "Strearoyl-[acp]"| can be hydrolyzed by acyl-ACP thioesterase enzymes |CITS: [7734968]|. However, before the fatty acids can be exported out of the chloroplast they must be activated to fatty acyl-CoAs by an outer envelope |FRAME: AT1G77590| activity. Once activated, they are exported to the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [14973169]|.
/
/A more common route involves desaturation of |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| to |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD|. Plants contain acyl-ACP desaturase enzymes, which introduce a double bond in the 9 position of |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs "stearoyl-[acp]"| to generate |FRAME: Oleoyl-ACPs "oleoyl-[acp]"| (see |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Stearate is the only fatty acid that is desaturated in its ACP-bound form. All other desaturation reactions occur only after the fatty acid has been attached to a glycerolipid backbone.
/
/In cyanobacteria stearate is also often desaturated to oleate. However, unlike plants, in cyanobacteria this desaturation reaction occurs only after the incorporation of stearate into a lipid. Prior to incorporation into a lipid, the fatty acid is transferred to a coenzyme A molecule, resulting in formation of |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|.
/
/Since the activity of the desaturase enzymes is often very high, |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| is often the main product of intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [8652653]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/A bewildering number of post-transcriptional modifications are introduced into cellular RNAs by different enzymes |CITS: [12581659]|. The most abundant post-transcriptional nucleobase modification in cellular RNAs is the isomerization of
/|FRAME:URIDINE| to |FRAME: CPD-497|, which is carried out by the enzyme pseudouridine synthase in a reaction that does not require any cofactors. In pseudouridine uracil is bound to the to ribose through C5 rather than through N1 as is the case for uridine. The synthase severs the normal glycosidic CN bond of uridine, flips the uracil moiety along its N3C6 axis, and forms a glycosidic C-C bond with C5. Pseudouridine is one of few molecules that have a glycosidic C-C bond.
/
/Pseudouridine synthases belong to four different families, which are represented in |FRAME:TAX-562| by the |FRAME: EG10454|, |FRAME: EG11177|, |FRAME: EG12609| and |FRAME: EG12044|. The only sequence element that is absolutely conserved among the four families of enzymes is a catalytic aspartic acid |CITS: [9425056][11720289][10428788]|.
/
/Pseudouridylation is found in organisms from all kingdoms. Mammalian rRNA contains about 100 pseudouridines per ribosome, and tRNAs contain an average of 3 - 4 pseudouridines. While many eukaryotes possess the ability to degrade pseudouridine, mammals appear to have lost this ability, and pseudouridine is excreted in their urine.
/
/Pseudouridine has been shown to serve as a source of uracil for a strain of |FRAME:TAX-562| that is deficient in pyrimidine synthesis |CITS: [4882030]|. It was shown that pseudouridine was first phosphorylated by a kinase to |FRAME: PSEUDOURIDINE-5-P| |CITS: [4334133]|, followed by hydrolysis to |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [4912525]|.
/The genes encoding these two enzymes have been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-364106|, a uropathogenic
/strain |CITS: [18591240]|. The genes were cloned, and the enzymes were purified and characterized,
/conforming the proposed function.
/
/Similar genes were found in the genomes of many bacteria and almost all eukaryotes |CITS: [18591240]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| (Chl<i>a</i>) and |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B| (Chl<i>b</i>) are light harvesting pigments that function to capture photons and transfer them to the reaction centers. Chl<i>a</i> and Chl<i>b</i> share the same structure except for the side chain at C-7 which is a methyl group in Chl<i>a</i> and a formyl group in Chl<i>b</i>.
/Whereas the biosynthesis of Chl<i>a</i> has been widely reported (see |FRAME:PWY-5086| and |FRAME:PWY-5064|), that of Chl<i>b</i> has been more elusive.
/
/Although it has long been known that |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| appears before |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B| when chlorophyll synthesis begins, little was known of the formation of the formyl group of Chl<i>b</i>. The discovery of the |FRAME: AT1G44446-MONOMER| (CAO) showed that this enzyme was sufficient for the transition of <i>a</i>- to <i>b</i>-type chlorophyll pigments.
/
/The enzyme was originally discovered in |FRAME: TAX-3052|, where mutants lacking in |FRAME:CHLOROPHYLL-B| biosynthesis were generated, and the gene responsible for the phenotype was isolated |CITS: [9770552]|.
/Subsequent work showed that the homologous |FRAME:AT1G44446| gene from |FRAME: ORG-5993| is required for chlorophyll b synthesis in that organism  |CITS:[10758481][10468639]|.
/
/The reduction of Chl<i>b</i> back to Chl<i>a</i> (and its hydrolysis to chlorophyllide <i>a</i>) is not as well characterized, although strongly supported by observations. The process has been demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> in etioplasts and etioplast membranes preparations from several organisms |CITS: [8215395][8071325][8576141][8954166][9857045]|.
/
/The compound |FRAME: CPD-7016| was identified as an intermediate in the reduction reaction and it was found that the reduction of |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B| to |FRAME: CPD-7016| proceeded with NADPH as reductant while the next step, reduction of |FRAME: CPD-7016| to |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|, required reduced ferredoxin |CITS: [9857045]|. This fact indicated that two enzymes, |FRAME: MONOMER-13499| and |FRAME: MONOMER-13500|, contribute to the overall reaction |CITS: [16228557]|.
/
/These combined findings suggest the existence of a cyclic pathway for the interconversion of the two types of chlorophyll molecules, as a response to changing light conditions |CITS:[8576141][16228557]|.

/In recent years the destruction of the ozone layer due to the action of halogen radicals and its negative effects on earth has occupied scientific and popular imagination.

Of the halides, |FRAME: CPD-845| is the most abundant and is released from specific fungi and plants and by the burning of biomass. |FRAME: CPD-12221|, which was extensively used as a soil fumigant and is known to strongly deplete stratospheric ozone, has been prohibited in recent times, but is produced by some marine organisms. |FRAME: CPD-7676| has lesser half life that |FRAME: CPD-845| and |FRAME: CPD-12221| but is known to affect the formation of marine aerosol formation and cloud condensation nuclei |CITS: [10508052]|. 
/
/The anthropogenic, marine and terrestrial biogenic sources of halides are known |CITS: [11791711][10508052]|, but the mechanisms of biosynthesis are poorly understood. The enzymes involved are halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT). Several flowering plant families are involved in the formation of methyl halides |CITS: [2371563] [ 7721844]|.

However, Gram-positive bacteria (such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|), archaea and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells lack a synthetase for charging |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs| with |FRAME: GLN| (although in some protists and fungi, it is imported from the cytosol into mitochondria).  This results in a misacylation of |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs| with |FRAME: GLT| by a nondiscriminating |FRAME: MONOMER-13959|.  A second enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX-7606|, is used to transamidate the misacylated |FRAME: L-glutamyl-tRNAGln| to |FRAME: Charged-GLN-tRNAs|.  In |CITS: [9342321]| and in |CITS: [18441100]|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of UMP appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
/as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. The pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (UMP), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX| catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP. The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER| |CITS: [15604701]|.
/
/The penultimate enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside diphosphate - in this case, the
/transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.
/
/Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is possible only at the level of nucleoside triphosphates, by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the major pathways of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA "TCA cycle"|. Glycolysis is essential under all conditions of growth, because it produces six of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules (the six compounds are |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|). Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.
/
/Even though glycolysis is often described starting with glucose, other hexoses (e.g. fructose) can also serve as input (as its name implies - glycose is a general term for simple sugars).
/
/Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:
/
/i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
/
/ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
/This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids. In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621| and |FRAME: PWY-6724|, respectively.
/Whereas the <i>plastidic</i> glycolysis pathway is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis (see |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS|), the <i>cytosolic</i> pathway (i.e. this pathway) is slightly modified. These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|.
/
/In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues, the primary function of the glycolitic pathway is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|. In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE|.
/
/In the cytosol, two enzymes catalyze alternative reactions to those of the plastidic pathway: |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.90| and |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.9|.
/
/The former enzyme, EC 2.7.1.90, provides an alternative to |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.11|; it utilizes |FRAME:PPI| rather than ATP to convert |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|. The plant cytosol lacks soluble inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatases and, consequently, contains higher concentrations of |FRAME:PPI| (up to 0.3 mM |CITS:[WEINER87]|). It has been proposed that the utilization of pyrophosphate rather than that of ATP in glycolysis is favored under nutritional <i>Pi</i> deprivation or oxygen deficiency |CITS:[DAVIES93][15012287]|.
/
/The second enzyme, EC 1.2.1.9, provides a bypass between |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:G3P|, which allows for their conversion without phosphorylation by a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase |CITS:[15012287][16927206]|. This reaction produces |FRAME:NADPH| but not |FRAME:ATP|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: SUCROSE Sucrose| is an important disaccharide in plants and plays a major role in moving carbon through the plant via the phloem from "source" tissues such as photosynthesizing leaves to "sink" tissues such as roots |CITS:[23393426]|. In the light, triose phosphate, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation, is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm where it is transformed to hexose phosphate by enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway. These hexoses are then used in |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY sucrose biosynthesis|. However, as shown in this pathway, |FRAME: SUCROSE| is also produced from the |FRAME: PWY-6724 degradation of starch reserves| using |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: GLC| exported from the chloroplast |CITS:[23393426]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/During |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch breakdown| in the chloroplast, |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: GLC| are liberated through a cascade of different enzymatic reactions. |FRAME: MALTOSE| can then be transported to the cytosol via |FRAME: AT5G17520-MONOMER MEX1| while |FRAME: GLC| can be transported by |FRAME:AT5G16150-MONOMER pGlcT|. 
/
/In the cytosol, the |FRAME: MALTOSE| is used by |FRAME: AT2G40840-MONOMER DPE2| to attach glucosyl units to the poorly defined class of compounds referred to as |FRAME: Soluble-Heteroglycans Soluble HeteroGlycans| (SHG). This liberates one glucose directly, but |FRAME: AT3G46970-MONOMER PHS2| can also liberate the deposited glucose from SHG in the form of |FRAME: GLC-1-P| |CITS: [16980562][23393426][16640603]|. This can then be used in a series of reactions shared with the other |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY sucrose biosynthesis pathway|. Namely, |FRAME: GLC-1-P| can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-12575| and then |FRAME:SUCROSE| via a |FRAME: SUCROSE-6P| intermediate. 
/
/Meanwhile, the |FRAME: GLC| derived from |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch degradation| can be converted to |FRAME: GLC-6-P| vias the activity of cytosolic hexokinase. This product can also then be funneled toward the production of |FRAME: GLC-1-P| via the activity of a |FRAME: AT5G51820-MONOMER phosphoglucomutase|. 
/
/There is another enzyme that can form sucrose - |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.13|. However, the name of this latter enzyme is misleading, since it has been shown that under most physiological conditions it catalyzes a sucrose cleavage reaction, and is thus involved in sucrose degradation |CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]| (see |FRAME: PWY-3801|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Tetrapyrroles are compounds whose molecules have four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked together by single-atom bridges between the alpha positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings. Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.
/The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|. This intermediate is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|.
/
/The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway shown here, which starts with glutamate, is found in plants, many bacteria (including |FRAME:TAX-562|), and the archaea. A second tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, which is found in animals, fungi, certain protozoans, and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, starts with glycine and succinyl-coA (see
/|FRAME:PWY-5189|). Interestingly, both pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing protozoan |FRAME: TAX-3039|.
/
/Regardless whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate |FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE| and proceed through the important intermediate |FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of different tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), the methanogenic coenzyme F<sub>430</sub> (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|),  |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|, and heme D.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Photosynthesis is a process in which energy from sunlight is harvested and used to fix |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE| into carbohydrates.
/Photosynthesis occurrs in bacteria, algae, phytoplankton and higher plants. During photosynthesis the solar energy is trapped by light-harvesting complexes, and used to split a donor molecule, generating high potential electrons that are channeled to NADP<sup>+</sup>, forming NADPH, which can be used to reduce |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/
/In oxygenic photosynthesis the donor molecule is water, resulting in the release of molecular |FRAME:OXYGEN-MOLECULE|. Some bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, in which different donor molecules are used for production of high potential electrons. An example are phototrophic sufur bacteria, which use sulfide, releasing molecular sulfur as a by-product.
/
/Photosynthesis is divided into two general subprocesses: the "light reactions" and the "dark reactions". The light reactions comprise the trapping of sunlight, the production of |FRAME:NADPH| and ATP, and the release of molecular |FRAME:OXYGEN-MOLECULE| (see |FRAME:PWY-101|).
/
/The dark reactions, better known as the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY|, comprise of the use of NADPH and ATP to fix |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE | and produce carbohydrates |CITS: [MatthewsvanHoldeII]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Backround</b>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|,
/and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many
/biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating
/several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.
/While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully
/understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|.
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine
/decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase
/(ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|).
/While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis,
/recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860]
/[14738999]|. In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time
/|CITS: [11537482]|.
/In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism
/|CITS:[3157043]|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/There are two flavors of the ADC pathway. In both cases |FRAME:ARG| is first converted to
/|FRAME:AGMATHINE| by a biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase. However, in enterobacteria and
/mycobacteria |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is converted directly to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| by the enzyme
/|FRAME:AGMATIN-CPLX| (see |FRAME:PWY-40|),
/while in higher plants, |FRAME:TAX-286| spp., |FRAME:TAX-642| spp., and
/lactic bacteria, |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is first hydrolyzed by |FRAME:CPLX-31| into |FRAME:CPD-597|
/and |FRAME:AMMONIA|, and |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is formed by removal of the ureido group from
/|FRAME:CPD-597| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-39|.
/
/It should be mentioned that it has been suggested that in |FRAME: TAX-287| this pathway can operate
/in a catabolic manner |CITS:[6768836][3534538][11673419]|, catalyzing the degradation of |FRAME:ARG|
/through |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| into succinate, supplying the bacteria with carbon and nitrogen
/(see |FRAME:ARGDEG-III-PWY|).
/Since the main catabolic arginine pathway in these bacteria is the succinyltransferase pathway (see
/|FRAME:AST-PWY|), there is still some debate whether this is a true arginine degradation pathway.
/However, it is agreed that the last two steps of the pathway are used for catabolic |FRAME:AGMATHINE|
/degradation |CITS:[12634339]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium Selenium| is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but has not yet been proven to be an essential micronutrient for land plants |CITS: [11683552][16307305]|. There is evidence, however, of Chlamydomonas proteins that contains a |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| residue suggesting that algal species might also require |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| |CITS: [17105189][12110581]|. The health requirement of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| for humans and animals can be met by crops and forage plants that contain selenocompounds. |FRAME: TAX-4232| among the oilseed crops was shown to be a good source for this micronutrient |CITS: [15012198]|. In addition, there is evidence that certain seleno-compounds, including |FRAME: CPD-12024|, have anti-carcinogenic properties |CITS: [21213327][14748935]|.   
/
/Despite its importance as a micronutrient, higher concentrations of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| are toxic to humans, other animals, and plants largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064][12753978][16661781]|. 
/
/In general, plants take up both |FRAME: SELENATE| and |FRAME: SELENITE| from soil. A series of |FRAME: PWY-6932 reduction steps| converts |FRAME: SELENATE| to |FRAME: SE-2| / |FRAME: CPD-678| and this is assimilated into the seleno-amino acids |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| and |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE| |CITS: [19309459]|.
/
/In Se accumulator plants, these seleno-amino acids may be modified to create organic seleno-compounds for storage. Seasonal weeds like |FRAME: TAX-3575| and |FRAME: TAX-83445| along with perennial weeds like |FRAME: TAX-41550| employ this strategy and accumulate high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| |CITS: [19800657]|. Se accumulation can help to protect plants against attacks by prairie dogs, insects, and fungi (see refs in |CITS: [21628258]|).
/
/Other plants, like |FRAME: ORG-5993| generate seleno-compounds as well, but rather than storing them, they transform them into less toxic volatile compounds
/such as |FRAME: CPD-12006| (DMDSe) that can then be released from the plants |CITS: [10759525]|. This process is also called phytovolatilization |CITS: [19656903]|.  
/
/While these strategies directly benefit the plants that employ them, they can also be put to use for the phytoremediation  of seleniferous soils that contain dangerously high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium|. Numerous insights into endogenous seleno-compound metabolism in plants have been gained through efforts to engineer plants that show improved selenium phytoremediation abilities |CITS: [15005814][19800657][19893365][17445958][10759525]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/To reduce the risk of misincorporating |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| into proteins, this compound can be methylated to form the non-coding seleno-amino acid |FRAME: CPD-12024|. Some Se hyperaccumulating plants may contain very high levels of this compound.
/
/In addition Se-non-accumulators and accumulators may also further metabolize |FRAME: CPD-12024| to produce the volatile |FRAME: CPD-12006|. For example, this compound, and not |FRAME: CPD-12005| appears to be the only seleno-volatile compound produced by the hyperaccumulator |FRAME: TAX-20406| whereas both are made by |FRAME:TAX-3707| |CITS: [14671009]|.
/
/The exact steps involved in this pathway have not been elucidated. It is possible that a series of reactions involving first a |FRAME: CPD-13774| intermediate and then a methaneseleniol intermediate are required, similar to the enzymatic steps observed for dimethyldisulfide biosynthesis |CITS: [16307305]|.
/
/It is also possible that some of the |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE| can be shunted toward |FRAME: CPD-12005| production if enzymes such as the bacterial thiopurine methyltransferase are found to occur in plants |CITS:[12003960] [16307305]|.
/
/|FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE Selenocysteine| may also be used to form |FRAME: CPD-13788| as this compound has been seen to accumulate in Arabidopsis over-expressing a selenocysteine methyltransferase enzyme and natively, in the hyperaccumulator |FRAME: TAX-20406|  |CITS: [NIGAM69A][5370015][16307305]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an important antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor. Higher plants and higher animals (but not humans) can synthesize ascorbate. Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative ascorbate biosynthesis routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis <i>in vivo</i> have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-882|) that requires the enzymes PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure to detect PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|) |CITS:[12954627]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate contents observed in a PMI silenced line of tobacco, the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|).
/
/Another controversy concerns the enzymes VTC2/VTC5 (named for Vitamin C defficiency). Two activities of VTC2 have been reported, GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase and GDP-L-galactose: hexose-1-P guanylyltransferase. One study suggested that the major activity of VTC2 is the guanylyltransferase activity |CITS:[17485667]|, whereas another study suggested that phosphorylase is the major activity of VTC2 |CITS:[17462988]|. The guanylyltransferase activity is critical for the so called |FRAME: PWY4FS-12| and |FRAME: PWY4FS-13|, both of which lead to the formation of L-galactose-1-P, an intermediate in the L-galactose pathway. Arabidopsis double mutants of VTC2/VTC5 are seedling lethal, which can be rescued by supplementation with L-galactose |CITS:[17877701]|. It demonstrates that the L-galactose pathway is a critical source of ascorbate, at least in Arabidopsis.  
/
/The extended VTC2 cycle includes an additional (unidentified) enzyme in comparison with the VTC2 cycle. The putative GDP-D-mannose 2"-epimerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of GDP-D-glucose to GDP-D-mannose. GDP-D-glucose, that can be formed by VTC2, strongly inhibits GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase, another enzyme in the VTC2 cycle. Thus, the conversion of the "toxic" GDP-D-glucose by the extended VTC2 cycle makes the extended pathway more favorable than the original VTC2 cycle (reviewed in |CITS:[17950389]|). In addition, the extended VTC2 cycle can make direct use of D-glucose-1-P which is derived from photosynthesis.   
/
/The intermediate GDP-sugars in ascorbate biosynthesis are also substrates for cell wall polysaccharides biosynthesis and protein glycosylation.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The formation of the formyl and methyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) directly involved in or representing sidesteps of the biosynthesis of this vital cofactors |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [10785666]|  is displayed in this pathway. Folates are involved in a wide range of key metabolic functions in plants |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]| mediating fluxes through C1-pathways with a high demand for methylated compounds such as secondary metabolites |CITS: [11337394]|.
/
/Plants prefer the polyglutamylated forms of folates (compare |FRAME:PWY-2161|, |FRAME:PWY-2161B|) since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [Scott00]| and meets the high demands for folates as observed in plants |CITS: [11960743]|. In addition the conjugated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|. The plant enzymes involved in this pathway, although essentially catalyzing the same steps, have been found to differ in many regards from their bacterial counterparts |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [14745019]| |CITS: [15500462]|.
/
/<b>Special information</b>
/
/Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pPABA) and glutamate moieties. The one-carbon units are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moietie, to the N-10 of the pPAPA moiety or are brigded in between those two (e.g. 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF) |CITS: [Basset05]|.
/The different forms of folates are jointly connected and easily convertible into each other through a tight network of reactions (|FRAME:PWY-2201|). Most of the enzymes have been identified in plants but some of them such as the formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase, presumably involved in the mutual conversion of tetrahydrofolate and its 10-formyl derivative remain to be demonstrated.
/
/Among the many folates |FRAME:N5-Formyl-THF-Glu-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:N5-Formyl-THF-Glu-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in the C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:N5-Formyl-THF-Glu-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|. 
/
/The complete set of folate enzymes is only present in mitochondria. However, the recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a different gene in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in those compartments. Interestingly, the enzyme hydrolyzing the polyglutamylated folates (&gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase) has been found to be an extracellular enzyme in plants |CITS: [8912628]|.
/Consequently, the transport and exact conversion of folates and their derivatives within the different cell compartments and their regulation pattern remains to be clarified before successfully attempting the endeavor to genetically engineer this pathway.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169</i>: This pathway is on the list of Common Viridiplantae Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most Viridiplantae species including algae. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Photosynthesis is composed of two processes, the light reactions and the dark reactions.
/The light reactons take place in the two photosystems - photosystem I and photosystem II, where light
/energy is harvested and is used to power the transfer of electrons from water, via a series of electron
/donors and acceptors, to the final acceptor NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH.
/The NADPH generated by the light reactions is used for sugar synthesis in the dark reactions.
/
/The light reactions also generate a proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, and the proton
/gradient is used to synthesize ATP. 
/
/There are two general chemical reactions involved in the light reactions: water oxidation in photosystem II,
/and NADP reduction in photosystem I. Both of the photosystems are large multiprotein complexes contained within
/the thylakoid membranes of all types of plants, algae and cyanobacteria, and both photosystems
/capture the light by means of large antennae systems, consisting of chlorophylls and carotenoids.
/
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506 "Photosystem II"| (PSII) utilizes solar energy for splitting water molecules, and transfers the
/electrons obtained from the water molecule via an electron transfer chain that ends with
/|FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE|.
/
/The excitation of the photosystem II reaction center (RC) via light absorption by chlorophylls in the
/antenna drives the transfer of a very high potential electron from the cluster of four chlorophylls bound to
/the D1- and D2-proteins (known as P680) to a pheophytin acceptor, resulting in a P680* radical.
/The radical transfers the electron to a firmly bound |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE| (PQ) called QA, which transfers it to a second, not firmly bound PQ, called QB.
/When QB is fully reduced and protonated to |FRAME: Plastoquinols| (PQH2) form, it diffuses from the QB-binding site into the lipid matrix of the membrane (for more information see |FRAME:CPLX490-3506|).
/
/The path between the two photosystems is not direct. The QB plastoquinone first transfers the electrons
/to a third complex, the plastoquinol--plastocyanin reductase (better known as the |FRAME:CPLX490-29|), where the electrons are transferred to the protein |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER|.
/Finally |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER| travels to |FRAME: CPLX-84|, and delivers the electrons to one
/of its components, P700, which is located on the inside of the thylakoids (the lumen).
/
/|FRAME:CPLX490-3509| (PS I) catalyzes the light driven electron transfer from |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER| to |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, which is on the stromal side of the membrane.
/As in photosystem II, photosystem I performs both light capturing and electron transfer. The light capturing is performed by the large antenna system that consists of 90 antenna chlorophylls and 22 carotenoids. The electron transport chain consists of six chlorophylls, two phylloquinones and three |FRAME:CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|.
/
/The electron transfer chain of PS I starts with P700, a heterodimer of a |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| and
/a |FRAME: CPD-10334| (the C13 epimer of chlorophyll a). As in photosystem II, a high energy electron is removed
/from P700 after excitation by light, and that electron is transferred through the system. The role of the electron delivered from photosystem II by plastocyanin is to re-reduce P700.
/
/From P700 the electron is transferred stepwise to A (a |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|  molecule),
/A0 (another |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|  molecule), A1 (a |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| molecule) and then through three 4Fe4S
/clusters, named FX, FA and FB.
/From the terminal 4Fe4S cluster, FB, the electron is transferred to the 2Fe2S cluster of
/|FRAME:Ferredoxins|, which leaves photosystem I and transfers the electron to the
/|FRAME:SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (EC 1.18.1.2), where NADP+ is finally reduced to NADPH.
/Under conditions of iron limitation, |FRAME: Flavodoxin| may replace the ferredoxin |CITS: [15977059]|.
/
/Cyanobacterial PS I can exist in both trimeric and monomeric forms. The trimeric form has been shown
/to be the prominent oligomeric state at low light intensity.
/The monomeric unit of PSI from |FRAME:TAX-32046| consists of 12 protein subunits, to which 127
/cofactors are non-covalently bound. 
/
/Some components of photosystem I and photosystem II in plants are different from those in
/photosynthetic microbes.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This pathway of cysteine biosynthesis is a two-step conversion of |FRAME: SER| to |FRAME: CYS| via |FRAME: ACETYLSERINE|. The pathway has been documented in bacteria |CITS: [Kredich96]|, archaea |CITS: [10613873]| and plants |CITS: [10940562]|.
/
/In the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-83333| both pathway steps are regulated. The first step is subject to very strong feedback inhibition by the final product, |FRAME: CYS|. The second step is regulated at the genetic level with both |FRAME: ACSERLYA-ENZRXN| isozymes being under the positive control of the cysteine-responsive |FRAME: PC00040|. 
/
/|FRAME: TAX-511145| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| produce two cysteine synthase isoenzymes (|FRAME: ACSERLYA-CPLX| and |FRAME: ACSERLYB-CPLX|). |FRAME: ACSERLYB-CPLX| is preferentially used for the biosynthesis of L-cysteine during anaerobic growth conditions |CITS: [6754864]| and is able to utilize thiosulfate instead of sulfide to produce S-sulfo-L-cysteine |CITS: [6373737]|.
/Only one of the isoenzymes (the |FRAME: EG10192|-encoded |FRAME: ACSERLYA-CPLX|) forms a complex with |FRAME: CPLX0-237|. CysK is also the only one of the two cysteine synthases that is required for cell viability on cysteine-free medium.
/
/In higher plants |FRAME:CPLX-1323| (SAT) and |FRAME:CPLX-1326| (OAS-TL) can form a similar enzyme complex, which is thought to play an important role in regulation.
/Within the complex SAT activity is higher and OAS-TL activity is lower than the respective free forms.
/When the complex dissociates, SAT becomes inactive and OAS-TL becomes more active.
/The formation of the complex is regulated by the concentration of |FRAME: ACETYLSERINE| (OAS)
/and |FRAME: HS|, where OAS triggers the dissociation of the complex and sulfide counteracts the effect of OAS.
/
/Both pathway steps iare reversible, and genetic and proteomic data suggest that the cysteine synthases may actually act as a sulfur scavenging system during sulfur starvation, stripping sulfur off of |FRAME: CYS| and generating any number of variant amino acids in the process |CITS: [Kredich96]|.

COMMON-NAME - glycolipid desaturation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3698179965:bxue
COMMENT - Fatty acids constitute a major component of plant membranes in the form of glycerolipids, mainly phosphoglycerolipids and glycosylglycerolipids. The majority of them have C16 or C18 carbon chains and are attached to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. In Arabidopsis, the major fatty acids are C16:0, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. Unsaturated fatty acids are significant to membrane functions such as photosynthesis and cold tolerance. C16:3 and C18:3 together make up more than 90% of the fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major glycosylglycerolipid of leaf chloroplast membranes |CITS: [arabidopsis94]|.   
/
/C18:1 is desaturated from C18:0 in the form of stearoyl-ACP (|FRAME: PWY-5147|) and is subsequently incorporated into glycerolipids. The rest of the unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:2 and C18:3, on the other hand, are desaturated from C16:0 or C18:1 after C16:0 and C18:1 are incorporated into glycerolipids. These latter desaturation processes are catalyzed by membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases, and occur in chloroplasts and ER. Fatty acid desaturation is best studied in Arabidopsis using desaturase mutants. 
/
/The depicted glycosylglyceride desaturation pathway illustrates the biosynthesis of 18:3-16:3-MGDG and 18:3-18:3-DGDG, the two most abundant glycosylglycerolipid found in chloroplast membranes. It is noteworthy that desaturation occurs on both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, and that the order of the desaturation steps on one chain versus the other is not known. Here, all the possible steps are presented.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Backround</b>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|,
/and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many
/biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating
/several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.
/While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully
/understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|.
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine
/decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase
/(ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|).
/While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis,
/recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860]
/[14738999]|. In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time
/|CITS: [11537482]|.
/In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism
/|CITS:[3157043]|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the ODC pathway |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is generated in a single reaction from
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| can be decarboxylated into |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| for two purposes - either
/anabolically, for the generation of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| as a polyamine on its own, or as a precursor
/of |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, or catabolically, as a carbon and nitrogen source. Catabolic
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| degradation is illustrated in the pathway |FRAME:ORNDEG-PWY|.

/Enteric bacteria possess two forms of ornithine decarboxylase, a biosynthetic
/(or constitutive) form (for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOX-BIO-CPLX|), apparently present in all
/strains of |FRAME:TAX-562|, and a biodegradative (or inducible) form
/(for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOXDEG-CPLX|), which is present in only some
/strains of |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [3157043] [1939141]|. Other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-287|
/appear to have only a single |FRAME:CPLX-25|, which is regulated in a complex manner to ensure
/proper expression for both polyamine biosynthesis and catabolism.
/
/Biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by both |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and is activated by |FRAME: GTP| and other nucleotides |CITS: [4370496]|.
/A synthetic compound, |FRAME:DIFLUOROMETHYLORNITHINE|, is a very potent mechanism-based
/(suicide) irreversible inhibitor of most ornithine decarboxylases, which has attracted much attention
/|CITS:[6421528]|.
/Interestingly, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzyme is completely immune to this inhibitor |CITS:[6800359]|.
/
/The formation of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| by the catalytic action of |FRAME:YKL184W-MONOMER| in |FRAME:TAX-4932| has been determined utilizing null mutants of the encoding gene (&Delta;spe1) which are unable to grow but can be rescued by addition of polyamines to the growth medium |CITS:[7929015] [7492339]|. The regulation of the |FRAME:YKL184W-MONOMER| activity in yeast has been proposed to occur via an antizyme-like mechanism which controls the degradation of the enzyme |CITS:[11535806]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>This Pathway in Bacteria</b>
/
/|FRAME: GLYCEROL Glycerol| uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8436953]|. Intracellular glycerol is converted to |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor. |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P "Glycerol-3-P"| is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains in the cell, where it is further metabolized. As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase |CITS: [9162046]|. 
/
/While |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm |CITS: [3522583][12893936]|. 
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can be further metabolized to |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| by either of two membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic |FRAME: AERGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| (encoded by the |FRAME: EG10394| gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|.  
/Under anaerobic conditions, a different |FRAME: ANGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| is preferentially expressed. This tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> operon, channels the electrons from |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Yeast</b>
/
/Under aerobic conditions |FRAME: TAX-4932| is able to utilize glycerol as a sole carbon and energy source. Glycerol degradation is a two-step process that involves translocation. The first step, glycerol phosphorylation, occurs in the cytosol. The product, glycerol-3-phosphate, enters the mitochondrion where it is converted to |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| |CITS:[191434]|. |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| is then returned to the cytosol, where it enters into either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.
/
/The genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing glycerol catabolism are regulated by the carbon source. Gene expression is repressed in the presence of fermentable carbon sources such as glucose, and upregulated by non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol |CITS:[191434][10536147][11142398]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants</b>
/
/In higher plants, the primary seed storage reserve is triacylglycerol. During seed germination, triacylglycerol is broken 
/down to fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are converted to sucrose via glyoxylate cycle to support seedling growth. 
/Radio tracer experiments have also demonstrated that glycerol can be converted to sucrose as well. The contribution 
/of carbon stored as glycerol is relatively small, being estimated of 5% of the total carbon. Two possible routes of 
/glycerol catabolism have been proposed. In the first pathway, glycerol is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate by 
/glycerol kinase, and then converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In the 
/second pathway, glycerol is coverted to dihydroxyacetone by NAD-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase, and then 
/phosphorylated to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by dihydroxyacetone kinase. The assertion of the first pathway, not 
/the second pathway, in plants is supported by the following evidence: glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate 
/dehydrogenase activities are detected in germinating seeds, whereas NAD-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase activity 
/is not; the highest expression of the glycerol kinase and the FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
/genes are detected during seed germination; the glycerol kinase mutant, gli1, of Arabidopsis is disrupted in glycerol 
/catabolism and accumulates glycerol. It is worth noting that, in addition to the mitochondrial FAD-dependent 
/glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, plants also have cytosolic and plastidial NAD-dependent 
/glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that can convert glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. But 
/the NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is unlikely to be involved in glycerol degradation since the 
/equilibrium constant favors the synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate. The product of glycerol degradation, 
/dihydroxyacetone phosphate, can be converted to sugars via gluconeogenesis.
